If a trapeze and a hula hoop had a baby, the lyra is it.  It's round, metal and wrapped.  It can spin! If you have always wanted to fly, and never tried...  If you have a desire to take hooping to a higher level... If you like curves, bored with tire swings, and your spinning class goes nowhere, this class is for you.  Do you want to have fun spinning in the air making pretty poses?  I'll teach you how to look and feel fabulous!  Please wear tight clothing that won't fall in your face when you are upside down! Or wear your spandex long-underwear.  I will try to have some skin tight t-shirts.  The more your legs are covered the better you will learn from me.  See you on top, Mandy Pants.</p>

        <p class="description">1.) MOLD MAKING WORKSHOPS
The first aspect of using the Dragon Smelter is creating the sand molds to cast art.  2 workshops will occur on playa at the DS (see ARTeries Location map) in the late afternoon @ 5:30 p.m. Tues, 08/30  and  Thurs, 09/02.  It last 2 hours, involves using steel frames, art “story” boards, sand & binder in a mini-cement mixer and pressure setting sand to create negative mold images & forms to cast into.   

2.) Large Casting Events:
5  p.m. to 7 p.m,  Wed. 09-01 & Fri. 09-03 @ Dragon Smelter 
The large casting events involve DS team members plus you, volunteers from BRC “walk-ups”.  We will fire the smelter kiln to 1900 degrees, deposit recycled aluminum cans in the crucible, then pour the melted contents into the sand molds to create relief sculptures. 

3.) METROPOLIS COINAGE 
The small coin smelter is a minature DS. small furnace, crucible and cast iron coin dye which is light and totally mobile.  We will be operating this during the big casting events at the DS & also daily @ different locations around Burning Man. Check with ARTERies for our daily location if you wish to participate, make yourself a coin on other than big casting event days.  This coin is a gifting to reward recycling by all citizens of BRC & also to celebrate the work of Recycle Camp in taking our aluminum cans every year, turning them into funding for Paiute Tribe youth education. For those who participate in this effort, bring their aluminum cans to Recycle Camps we want to convert one or two of them into a “Metropolis Coin” as a gift to reward your effort. 2 to 3 members of our Dragon Smelter team will operate this little machine daily making coins with or for you.


4. P.M. PLAYING WITH FIRE

Dragon Smelter spits flames from it’s mouth and tail. You can participate in running these effects at night with us.  Come to the DS when you see them start up.  Our team will show you how to safety set these shooting flame affects off.

We all have stories of clearing dark energy, shielding ourselves, psychically intuitively knowing what needs to be done, even a sense of having spirit helpers move through us. Shamanista protocols make channeling routine.  and sometimes we also have to rescue the lost child of the early trauma, in soul retrieval, to get them unstuck.</p>

In all healing modalities, we need to clear negative energy while shielding ourselves from it. Shamanista protocols employ an animal spirit ally to help us, in a drumming journey to effect a shamanic state of consciousness, where we can 'see' what needs to be done. Placing positive light in place of the extraction is a crucial end maneuver.</p>

All you Polyamorous, poly-curious, and poly-friendly folks out there on the playa are invited to join us for a discussion about the practical issues of loving more than one in an open, responsible multi-person relationship. There are many workable forms of Polyamorous relationship - polyamory is polymorphic! There is much wisdom in the poly community which can be helpful to people trying to make *any* relationship work, monogamous or Polyamorous. There will be a facilitated discussion in which you can get your questions addressed and some of the knowledge in our community can be shared.

The implications for both personal growth and societal balance from removing one of the key distortions of self knowledge will be explored. 

Also, the (in)famous Hair Part Theory will be talked about, which explains why some people are so out of balance and why we have such a polarized culture.  The real reason why Al Gore lost the election, why Carter is a much better past president, why Andy Rooney, Steve Martin, Hitler, Blagoyovich and many other entertainment and political characters are so unusual, all find explanations with the way they part their hair. and of course, how mirrors have been fooling them even more so because they reflect the opposite hair part!</p>

This workshop will have a lecture/discussion component which details how old religious and discipleship methods are fading and new collaborative and individual paths of awakening are evolving. We will discuss ways that each person can help, and be helped, within our community, to contribute to the positive transformation of each other and the planet. Some interactive finish involving meditation, eye-gazing, small groups or what the moment calls will conclude the workshop. Festival culture will be prominently discussed as a pilgrimage, a community celebration and prayer, and a vortex for energy to uplift the planet. - by Karl Baba</p>

We will define consensual non-monogamy and differentiate it from other relationship styles. We will share our experiences in the open relationship world.

The main focus is a Synchronizing Template that I have created that is a tool to visualize the interconnectivity of individual realization to that of a collective participation. Touching on art movement, interdimensional existence and new forms of government. As for me I have created "Tribe13" and the "Interdimensional Art Movement" which has helped catapult and strenghten great visionaries such as Luke Brown, Carey Thompson, and so many more including making the vision of such greats as Robert Venosa, Martinna Hoffman, Alex and Alyson Grey acccesible to communities. My Workshop aims to make vision clear and most important "synchronize" to our potential. Thank you for this opportunity. -Roman Villagrana a.k.a. SynchroMystic</p>

        <p class="description">Why wait until retirement to explore the world?

Technology is making it ever easier to work online, so why not take the next step, take your home on the road, and really be location independent? Give in to your wanderlust - come learn how!

Camp Nomadia founders Seeder & Serolynne (www.technomadia.com) have been living together technomadically since May 2007, having giving up their conventional fixed homes to create a conscious merging of life, work, sustainable living, travel, community and adventure.  They currently base their adventures out of their custom built, solar-powered, and thoroughly geeked-out 17’ fiberglass trailer. Their geographic flexibility has allowed them to travel back and forth across the continent, attending interesting events (and regional burns!), meeting amazing people, and seeing incredible things -- all without sacrificing their ability to run their software development and consulting business, or lessening their ties to friends, family, and community.

Some of the other experienced technomads from Camp Nomadia will also be sharing their stories, offering up practical advice and insights to help others make the leap to a life without a fixed home base.

This workshop will focus on practical tips on how to leave a fixed-place existence behind and explore a life of technomadism. Topics covered will include selecting the right arsenal of technology to work successfully on the road, constructing your ideal mobile home (wheels, sails, backpacks, or...), and legal issues such as domicile, voting, vehicle registration, and taxes.
Immediately after the Technomadic Lifestyle Workshop there will be a Nomadic Happy Hour, so plan to hang around to mix and mingle with a bunch of other current and future nomads.

Camp Nomadia is intentionally unplaced this (our third) year, so check for our on-playa location at Playa Info (and likely on our website as well) and come find us.</p>

This multi-year project is a cross-disciplinary approach to studying Black Rock City and its inhabitants during the Burning Man Festival. Combining traditional archaeological methods with ethnographic approaches, researchers are collecting and analyzing information about the construction, use, and understanding of the physical environment and the lives and interactions of people within that temporary city. Archaeological methods consist of survey, mapping of individual camps, and surface collection of the city as constructed during the festival. This data will be combined with the results of data collection from the clean-up efforts overseen by the Bureau of Land Management. Ethnographic methods include structured and open-ended interviews, participant observation, virtual ethnography, discourse analysis, and secondary research.  Ethnographic findings will be integrated with archaeological data to present a holistic study of Burning Man. In merging archaeological and ethnographic approaches, this project combines analysis of the physical elements of the city with an exploration of the meanings of space and the festival in larger context. Research questions address the creation, use, and significance of physical space and place, the relationship between participants and their environment, temporality and change in ritual practice, and perceptions of self in relation to the landscape.  This collaborative project focuses on the materiality and cultural expressions of Burning Man, aiming to uncover the intersecting ethereal and material dimensions of the festival and to study the event's significance for those who create, reside in, and deconstruct Black Rock City.</p>

        <p class="description">Want to know more about Gabrielle Roth’s 5Rhythms movement practice?  Come to this 90-minute class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms:  flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right.  With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms® opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy.  In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.  Taught by Stacey Butcher.</p>

It is a hybrid practice combining Yoga, Qi Gong, strength training, and healing to construct an effective, energy producing routine that uses isometric exercises to build muscle capability and core strength, while providing a sturdy platform for those muscles to operate from.  The routine focusses primarily on connecting the shoulders and hips to their associated muscle groups, and is an excellent departure point for peoples own search for health through a variety of healing practices - which are presented within the routine in an introductory manner. The benefits of this exercise style are most noticeable by those who perform tasks such as construction, labor, and computer work, or those who just want a tune-up.</p>

        <p class="description">Kabbalah, the ancient system of Jewish mystical and esoteric thought, has a complex and nuanced understanding of gender identity and eroticism.  Men with female souls, a multi-gendered God -- this is not the BS about some old man in the sky judging you for jerking off.  In this non-apologetic and non-traditional workshop, we'll look at a few Kabbalistic teachings on gender and sexuality, particularly queer sexuality and transgender souls.  The workshop will be led by an 8-time burner, radical faerie & Ph.D. candidate in Jewish Thought who has published 2 books on Kabbalah and taught Jewish mysticism for 15 years.</p>

        <p class="description">“It is NOT events that bother us, but OUR THOUGHTS about those events.” - This participatory and experiential workshop will bring you freedom from our stressful thoughts. Thoughts like… “People should appreciate me more. My parents should have been more available. I’m missing my life mission.” … these thoughts can run undetected in the background of our mind and sap our energy and enthusiasm. When I think “no one likes me” then I don’t return phone calls, I don’t initiate conversations and thus I bring about the exact thing which I believe. 

Using group work, guided meditation, and written exercises, this workshop will show you how to make friends with the mind. We will create an atmosphere of open, honest and authentic communication to allow participants to feel safe to explore thoughts that they are ashamed of. I believe that every thought has a valuable gem of wisdom to offer us and the workshop is a playground for looking at how that is true.</p>

We will access healing through sounds/silliness/laughter in groupwork and partner work finding partners within the community of the class (not necessarily someone we come with if we come "alone").  We will access healing through breathing and partner stretching and group/partner touch/massage.  Once we are warmed up and comfy cozy, we will embark on therapeutic flying, combining elements of sound healing, touch and mutual support as we journey off the ground and into the air!
The class/workshop will be progressive, in that if participants were to return for more than one class, they will be taught skills that would layer on top of the skills they learned in the previous class even while others were learning more basic flying techniques.  I will have varied community therapeutic exercises so that if someone returns for each class (which would be great!) they will continue to benefit and learn new skills and have new experiences.</p>

Give and receive healings for happiness, well being and the removal of emotional blockages. The healing will be centred at the Base or Root and Heart Chakra for sexual healing. Hands on healing all boundaries are respected. Singles and partners welcome. 

Every relationship we ever experience with our parents, friends, kids, lovers, co-worker, boss etc, has an effect on who we are our personalities and our sexuality. Many times this works like a wall that we put up that keeps us from our true desires and keeps us from happiness and it can also work like a chastity belt of; rejection, anger, fear and other emotions. When the class is over participants will feel one of these emotional weights have been lifted. They will feel lighter. Their Heart Chakra’s will be open and Root Chakra will be lighter and feel protected. it is possible relationships of every kind will be more nurturing and healthy.</p>

My practice of late has been to reside in that in between space without concepts, where I have access to multiple timing/directions at the same time.</p>

Each pair would get a medium sized brush, a small cup of water and 2 or 3 colors of paint in tiny containers or on a palette to minimize waste. Then we'd talk about different sources of inspiration for imagery such as music, personality, mood, body contours and clothing. I'd like to put on some music when they start painting and give each person about 15 minutes to paint before trading places.</p>

There is also a need for understanding how your state of mind, diet, and other medications can drastically change your experience, as well as the effects of “layering”, or mixing different substances. I will also be discussing the importance of safety from both a legal standpoint, as well as a practical standpoint. Also a discussion of the on-playa resources for those who find themselves or a campmate in psychological distress. and where to go in case there is a need for professional medical and/or psychological assistance.

        <p class="description">Learn tools of calm presence, clear boundaries and open hearts needed to hold the ritual space for the women of Critical Tits. Men and Women welcome as Volunteers. This year, once again, the Critical Tits Ride will lead to a Women's Only Ritual on the open playa. The volunteer's role is to create and hold the ritual - by welcoming all on their bikes, marking the edge of the Ritual Ring with your bodies and amplifying its sacred nature with your intention of honor and respect for the Goddess in all women - no small task, eh!! 

This is an essential job to the success of the ritual and the CT Crew is full of gratitude for your participation in this way. During the Ritual, all who join us to hold space along the edge of the Ritual Ring will be asked to face outward, away from the dance towards the open playa. It is no sign of disrespect to you. This desire comes from the intention to create as safe a haven as possible for every woman present. Dancing in a circle of 'watching' individuals could be extremely daunting to some women. 

Our highest intention is to create safety for the most vulnerable in our midst. We are also inviting you to ask all looky-loos and active photographers to be respectful as well – either practicing camera rule #1 of ‘ASK FIRST’ or better yet inviting them to put down their cameras, turn their backs and join you along the sacred edge. 

Gathering at the pre-ritual training gives all an opportunity to learn possible new tools of communication as wells as to build the connections between you that will hold the women of CT with love and integrity. This job calls for BIG hearts and grounded spirits, and we know you are out there! 

We need volunteers, as well, for set up/clean up, bike parking, and drumming. If you want to get involved, contact us at info2010(at)criticaltits(dot)com.</p>

        <p class="description">AUDIOREOLAE...An interactive sculpture/stage/loopstation that allows the participant to create real-time audio loops. Sounds captured may include drumbeats, vocals, guitar melodies or other found sounds. The participant stands under an arch containing speakers, immersed in the sound of their loops, from above and below. The user's figure is framed in a circular opening, a reference to the etymology of the words areola (diminutive form of the Greek word for "open space"), aureole (the traditional "halo" of light around sacred figures in Medieval art) and the literal "audio relay" that is being created. The installation resembles a vertical silver ring, with bamboo fiberglass-clad plywood bases and a semi-transparent fabric covered spaceframe arch, illuminated from within. The looping instructions are very simple, and will be clearly posted. The pedal/trigger will be a large button in the center of the installation, and a 1/4" input, microphone, and electric guitar will be provided. 

The user interface will be very straightforward and minimal. A participant walking by the sculpture with a djembe could -within minutes- be creating her own drum circle, with literally dozens of versions of herself playing in unison. Amateur singers will be able to experience harmonizing to themselves. Guitar players will be able to lay down the chords to their songs and then write BRC-inspired solo melodies.</p>

          <h4>Intentional Massage</h4>

        <p class="description">This class will show how massage can be enhanced both for the giver and receiver using the techniques of "touch relaxation", "seeing fingers" and "focused intention". Individuals and couples are welcome (you'll pair up for practice either way). The class will emphasize healing rather than sensual massage, but the techniques are equally applicable to both.

1) Touch relaxation: often the receiver is ignored in massage classes, and I think that's a shame, because all of the really important work has to be done by them, and the giver is but a guide and assistant. This technique is based on focused intention to relax in response to touch. The technique is practiced in pairs during the class.

2) Seeing Fingers: I tend to not even bother with my eyes when giving with massages, because all the important things you can perceive you "see" through your fingertips. This is a skill that can only be learned through practice, and it ties in strongly with the previous concept.

3) Focused Intention: I do some practical demonstrations of what happens when your attention (and therefore intention) wanders during massage, then have a discussion and practice regarding how intention shapes all of what you accomplish during a massage. 

In the past, people who have attended, especially massage therapists, have been very appreciative of the emphasis on connection between the the giver and receiver vs. specific techniques.

Taught by Dreamweaver in the 4th Chakra Temple at Sacred Spaces.

I have taught this class with Ascension Tribe several times in the past. I'm self-taught but have been giving and receiving massage for most of my life, and have accumulated my knowledge from a variety of sources, experiential, scientific, and spiritual.</p>

        <p class="description">Throat Singing sounds like a didgeridoo, only anyone can do it without any instrument at all. 
Learn several Tuvan styles of singing one of which is also used by Buddhist monks as well. 
Women and men can both throat sing naturally. 
Through listening and instruction you'll  learn one or more of these different styles and how to combine them.
I also have been combining throat singing with beat boxing. This is a lot of fun and adds an awesome dimension to beat boxing. 
Once you learn to do it, and become proficient at it, you can throat sing into a didgeridoo and the resonant tones produce and amazing sometimes hypnotic affect.

Come by Camp Gratitude during the day and ask if RememberZ is available. If you catch me in one of many free moments we'll have a lesson. There will also be specific scheduled events as well.</p>

        <p class="description">Want to know more about Gabrielle Roth’s 5Rhythms movement practice? Come to this 90-minute class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms® opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive. Taught by Douglas Drummond</p>

        <p class="description">The Werbeck Technique (www.waldorfmusic.org), based on the work of Swedish artist Valborg Werbeck-Svärdström, is a spiritually enlivened interpretation of the processes involved in singing.  In this interactive workshop, we will work toward developing knowledge of the essential nature of song and summon our "spiritual forces" to assist us as we endeavor to discover our true voices--in all their wonderous purity!  Deceptively simple yet remarkably effective, the Werbeck Technique is the perfect method for every aspiring singer--regardless of age or experience level--and offers lifelong vocal health, longevity, range and FREEDOM!

Lead by Werbeck Technique practitioner Janis Kelly (www.janis-kelly.com), a professional musician, music educator, singer-songwriter, recording artist and "Musical Emissary" from Boulder, CO, "Cosmic Singing" is an opportunity to let your voice "come out and play" in a safe, supportive, semi-structured setting!  In Janis' own words, "...even though I studied voice extensively, directed choirs for years and sang professionally for my entire adult life, I never considered teaching voice lessons or coaching singers until I discovered this method.  It--quite literally--allowed me to discover my voice's true potential and has changed my approach to singing at depth."

Come on out and let the cosmos sing through you!</p>

        <p class="description">There is great change upon the wind, a paradigm shift the likes of which humanity has never witnessed before. We can all sense it. We can feel it in our very bones, calling from the depths of our collective psyche as we draw ever closer toward what Terrance McKenna referenced as the “eschaton”, the ultimate transcendence from a cultural worldview of Logos (Creative Word) to Holos (Holistic & Collective Conscious Evolution). As we move into the New Millenium, facing the apparent and inevitable collapse of old paradigm structures, it becomes ever more vital for us, both individually and as a species, to recognize the fundamental importance of our unified state of existence both spiritually and as conscious co-creators within the Gaian/Human collective. Toward that end, tryptamines, both endogenous and exogenous, provide us all with a unique opportunity and ability to recognize and noetically realize that unified state of universal consciousness that intimately connects us all, to each other, to all of nature and to Source itself. Through the entheogenic experience we can effectively open our hearts and minds to literally limitless possibilities for fostering harmony, beauty, peace, sustainability and greater economic and environmental efficiency, that will allow us as a species to not only survive but thrive upon our planet in the establishment of the age old vision of the Universal Brother/sisterhood of all Humankind. How can the noetic revelations that the tryptamine experience serve us in this process? Come and join Hal Lucius Nation from the Temple of Awakening Divinity in this enlightening and engaging forum where we will collectively envision and discuss these possibilities.</p>

Sweat is an ancient and universal form of self healing, whether done in the gym, the sauna, or the sweat lodge. We do it on the dance floor. The more you dance, the more you sweat. The more you sweat, the more you pray. The more you pray, the closer you come to ecstasy. - Gabrielle Roth

Discover ancient techniques that lead to a deeper awareness of your own self, and ways to greatly expand the connection with your lover. Move deeply past the surface sensations, as you explore the unions between your minds, emotions, spirits, sexualities, and body temples. 

Go for the "full being orgasm", the sacred erotic dance that expands and transports you both to unimaginable ecstasy.

This is a clothing-optional, contact-optional workshop for couples of all genders and orientations.</p>

You will find yourself reconnecting with your innate beauty, wholeness and power in each moment.

        <p class="description">The Radical Honesty technique includes having practitioners state their feelings bluntly, directly and in ways typically considered impolite. People who practice Radical Honesty employ a collection of techniques to shift them out of acceptable norms of "white lying" for the purpose of having a more truthful relationship with themselves and others.

In this workshop we will cover Radical Honesty in business, personal interactions, legal situations, relationships, and SEX! Practicing Radical Honesty as an individual is hard, but it doesn't have to be. Me and people like me have developed a calm and peace from this practice. This does involve immense change in those who are used to telling white lies or lies in general.

If you are ready for a RADICAL change in your life or you just want to learn about this crazy practice, come to Practicing Radical Honesty for Beginners.</p>

Please join CBGB in a 2,500 year old yogi tradition of honoring the sun, Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation).  The Sanskrit word namaskar stems from namas, which means "to bow to" or "to adore."   Surya Namaskar, is a series of 12 postures performed in a single, graceful flow. Each movement is coordinated with the breath; Inhale as you extend and stretch, and exhale as you fold and contract. The Sun Salutation builds strength and increases flexibility while removing mental dirt, revitalizing your body, relieving stiffness and restoring balance.  This workshop is open to all individuals’ who possess a mat or towel, regardless of your experience.  See you on the playa, Namaste!</p>

spacetime, which has lead to a coherent understanding of the
fundamental structure of the universe and our existence in it.  In
this presentation, Jamie Janover will take you on a journey through
humanity’s evolution, exposing the changes necessary to produce a
Unified Physics; a unification of not only the four forces of nature,
but also evolution and the occurrence of consciousness.  Haramein's
theory demonstrates as well a parallel between ancient codes in
documents and monuments.  This all-encompassing theory may prove to be
one of the most important discoveries of our time.</p>

        <p class="description">TUE A Taste of Compassionate Connecting: getting to know each other, experiencing our life energy in a group--what's alive in you and me--we get to feel the power of being known and experience a sense of connection and belonging.
 
WED Awareness: acknowledging our observations/judgments, feelings, needs and requests (OFNR). We get to focus our conscious awareness in the directions that we choose. By getting clear on OFNR, we develop competence to begin a journey into greater depths of our being.
 
THU Presence through Self-Empathy: several processes are introduced to help us to become consciously aware of our judgments, observations and the life energy within us. Through these processes, participants will gain valuable tools for self-connection, resulting in feelings of natural compassion, inner-peace and harmony.
 
FRI The Flow of Empathy: after we are self-connected, we now have some free energy to offer our presence and respectful listening to others. We aren't there to fix people, but to help them get clear with their own life energy. In this session, participants will gain practical knowledge of what is empathy and what is not--and will have opportunities to practice and get feedback.
 
SAT Spaceless-Timeless Presence of Empathetic Role Play: empathetic listening can help us to get clear with our pain relating to people who are not physically present. They may have passed on from this life, and we may have some unresolved hurts with them or others. The facilitator demonstrates the power of role plays with participant issues by taking on the spirit of their higher selves--in Christ consciousness.</p>

The purpose of the 5Rhythms practice is to embrace the wholeness of our being, and this includes the shadowlands of the heart--the places we may not enter so willingly.  But, Burning Man can easily take us there.  Come enjoy your bad-ass beauty, your rugged raw heart, and allow your castle to crumble into ecstasy.</p>

What a perfect opportunity to practice the 5Rhythm dance meditation in relation to thoughts, feeling sensations, and experience unknown to us. So often we keep ourselves safely contained in the known and expected.  But you did not come to Burning Man for that!  This class is about reminding your body how to dance with and welcome what’s new, and what's not so familiar, what may not be so comfortable, nice, known or beautiful. This is off-road dancing with off-road people; add only a slight bit of willingness, and you will quite likely get deliciously lost.</p>

        <p class="description">Tired of workshops, spiritual practices, seeking and striving and trying to make things happen in the world?

How about just Following Life? How about letting go of the striving and seeking and, instead, just connecting intimately with whatever life is bringing to your awareness right now, in this moment? This feeling, this sensation in your body, this thought. How about following this, not analyzing it or trying to figure out, but just allowing it and following it till it reveals life’s wisdom?

When we follow life we come into attunement with life. The struggle with life ceases, the tensions in our bodies, emotions and thoughts unwind and we open to the grace that is life. We make ourselves available to opportunities and possibilities greater than anything we could ever plan or strategize with our rational minds. Solutions present themselves, relationships heal and blossom, health and vitality expands and our sheer presence becomes a healing force in the world. 

Following Life sessions are gatherings where we hold space together to more deeply follow life. Led by experienced facilitators we sit or lie in a circle and practice connecting with and actively following the body sensations, emotions and thoughts that arise in our awareness. We alternate speaking what is arising in our awareness while others listen and follow what is happening in their awareness. We create a collective field that allows everything and anything to be present, to be felt, healed, balanced and transformed. We accelerate our spiritual progress and evolution while becoming more deeply human and connected.

I have found these following life sessions to be the simplest, most grounded, yet powerful experience I have ever had and I love how deeply connecting they are with the people I come to meet and know through the practice. – RJ Noble, Bali

Tobin Giblin and Charlie Rebich, both long-time meditation practitioners and teachers, will facilitate these sessions on the Playa.</p>

        <p class="description">Wherein you will unlock the secrets of the remarkable on-and-off Playa gift of edible bounty that is Feed the Artists. Learn the origins of the simple, radical idea of burning man camps organizing to share their meals with ‘starving artists’ who spend most of their Playa time installing and creating art for the community, and the resulting magic which continues to ensue and multiply with the breaking of bread, be it pita-, gluten-free, or -pudding . Share resources about Reno area food sources, refrigeration, and cooking facilities. Adapt this concept and infrastructure for your next regional burning man event, community or nonprofit event and watch the radical inclusion grow to biblical proportions! Let there be food!</p>

        <p class="description">Join your fellow Burner Foodies (as opposed to food burners) to swap stories, sources, and strategies for creating your own moveable feast in the desert. We’ll discuss recipes, kitchen set-ups, equipment, sanitation, and everything related to cooking in this challenging environment for a couple or crowd. This is your chance to connect with those who love to nourish their fellow campmates and citizens of BRC.  The Roundtable will also be the beginnings of a forum for playa chefs to keep in touch throughout the year!  Whether you are new to Playa cooking or have been kitchen-witching for years, come share a toque with us!   And if you’re feeling like showing off your cooking chops, bring your favorite playa-inspired dish to share with others!</p>

Then, we will be practicing "eye gazing" raising awareness of how present or distracted we are with ourselves and the soul in front of us.  This awareness and practice can bring abundance, joy and depth of purpose into our lives.  The greatest gift you can give is your presence.</p>

So much more transpires when speaking is outlawed, come see the realm of possibilities in this worldly wordless experience. Physical theatre, singing, role play may be employed.

This workshop will focus on practical tips on how to leave a fixed-place existence behind and explore a life of nomadism. Topics covered will include connectivity, constructing your ideal mobile home (wheels, sails, backpacks, or...), and legal issues such as domicile, voting, vehicle registration, and taxes. Immediately after the Living Nomadic Workshop there will be a Nomadic Happy Hour, so plan to hang around to mix and mingle with a bunch of other current and future nomads. Camp Nomadia is intentionally unplaced this (our fourth) year, so check for our on-playa location at Playa Info and come find us - probably around 6 & H.</p>

It's a form of dance; and it's all about owning the dancefloor, owning your space, doing very little or a million things, but having your attitude just make everything worthwhile. It's VERY 3rd chakra and self esteem building because you learn to put on a persona to make the dance work (or werq) and then you just BECOME that persona!!!! All are welcome.</p>

NAVIGATING AND RECLAIMING THE DEPTHS OF YOUR PSYCHE

By Sunny Strasburg

In this workshop, we will use the dream workbook, The Alchemist’s Path: Navigating and Reclaiming the Depths of Your Psyche (Strasburg, 2007) as an entry point to discuss how each of our lives are the hero’s journey. The workbook, The Alchemist’s Path contains elemental imagery that Sunny painted from a series of “Big Dreams”. These images are based in alchemy and a visual, elemental and spatial narrative. Each of us creates a “life story” in which we give meaning to our lives. The intention of the imagery and exercises in this presentation are to facilitate a beginning of reclamation- to give meaning and importance to our life stories.

We will examine how during our lives, we have traveled through four alchemical regions as wee have walked our individual Hero’s or Heroine’s Journey, represented by the elements, water (Solutio), Fire (Calcinatio), Air (Sublimatio) and Earth (Coagulatio).

We will view these stories through the lens of Jungian, archetypal, and depth psychology, and explore concepts in mythology, alchemy, archetypal imagery, and depth psychology and how they relate to the symbols in both our waking and dreaming lives. If time allows, we will process experiential exercises which follow the path through the four elements. Using the images from the workbook, we have an evocative starting place. The written and practical exercises are intended to help facilitate the audience’s reclamation and integration of these archetypal realms.

        <p class="description">Intention:

The intention and purpose of the Alchemical Gender Circle is to increase understanding of the experiences we have as men and women, both with ourselves and with one another. This is facilitated by enhancing the capacity to listen to another’s experience and creating an intentional space in which we feel open to communicate our feelings. This was developed by me and influenced by the work of Avrom Altman. I have facilitated the circle in many diverse groups of people. Everyone from addicts in resident rehabilitation, parents of autistic children to art collectives and urban family tribes.

Process:

The process of the circle is in three phases. I am present to act as group facilitator and therapist. During the first phase, the women of the group gather to form a circle. The men in the group hold and contain them by forming a concentric circle around the women. Then the women are given the opportunity to speak about how they feel about

·   Introduce themselves and what brought them here

·   Their gender roles, both in their families and society.

·   What romance and dating/partnerships means to them

·   What they wish the men in their lives understood about them

The men are silent as they listen to the women’s process.

During the second phase, the roles are reversed. Without comment, the men and women exchange places and the men move to the center circle and the women hold the space in a circle around them. The men speak about their gender roles and the women in their lives as the women listen to the men’s process.

In Phase 3, both the women and men gather in one large circle and speak about what the experience was for them.</p>

        <p class="description">Want to know more about Gabrielle Roth’s 5Rhythms movement practice?  Come to this 90-minute class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms:  flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right.  With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy.  In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.</p>

The remarkable sonic vibration of the Earth Harp creates ascending overtones and healing harmonics that not only provide the perfect soundtrack for the yoga practice, they also transmute and sublime one's energy to promote physical/energetic health and creative inspiration. Joined by William on the Earth Harp, Andrea Brook will lead a class, suitable for all levels of practitioners, through the physical yoga practice, guiding one’s conscious attention to the emotional and psychological responses, and inspiring the spirit to soar. MASS (Music, Architecture, Sonic, Sculpture) Ensemble is an internationally renowned performing arts group that combines unique musical sculptures and installations with traditional instrumentation, creating an unforgettable multi-sensory experience. The Earth Harp places the audience inside the instrument, as the golden strings span out from the stage and use the Temple of Transition to create a 120 foot harp.</p>

Salsa Dancing. Salsa is a style of music and dance that breaths rhythm and movement into one. Its origin expands from Afro Cuban/ Caribbean/ Latin American beat and culture.

What makes Rueda unique is that the dancing is done in the "wheel", as a group, with a “caller” who determines the moves to been done at any giving time. Each move, or "call", has a name. After entering the circle (ideally with a partner, but not 100% necessary,) the leaders advance to the next follower in the wheel after a move or two is performed. This rapid changing of partners makes for a fun and friendly exchange all within the time of one song.

Many of the moves also have hand signals as well as names, in order to be able to dance in a loud club setting. The Rueda can be as small as two couples, or as large as a space can hold — as many as a hundred couples. When the circle to too large for the space, concentric circles may be formed.

When dancing Rueda, there is a new group dynamic that happens. What is not obvious when watching Rueda, is the new level of awareness required to have a group dance flow smoothly, and look sharp AND keep it fun! Dancers learn to open their sphere of awareness, their peripheral vision, beyond the normal restricted "bubble" of solo or partner dancing. In this way, dancers coordinate and adjust their individual feel and timing and style so as to make the Rueda "click". When this happens, it is very exciting indeed!

Yoga nidra is a deep meditation practice that mimics the stages of actual sleep; it’s like sleep with a trace of deep awareness that opens portals to your unconscious mind.  Swami Satyananda Saraswati is one of the first to have codified teachings from early Vedic literature into eight stages of practice.  Christy Anandaconda will lead you through a nidra practice in Swami Satyananda’s framework that includes breath play and exploration, also drawing upon Donna Farhi’s inquiries into current breathing and Blandine Calais-Germain’s discussions on the anatomy of breathing.  Bring or create an intention that you would like to work with, something you would like to manifest in your own life.  In yoga nidra, this is called a sankalpa, and it focuses your mind at the beginning and end of the practice.  Meditate with this sankalpa until the manifestation you desire occurs.  Yoga nidra will help you absorb this resolve at the cellular level.</p>

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels.  Bring your water and if possible, a stick that’s your height (3/4-1” bamboo, dowel, etc.)  We’ll have some available.

Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army.  He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like "gifting," eh?)  He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers.  Today, LSA is practiced widely in Vietnam, and there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal.  Also, LSA is spreading around the US, plus Canada, France, and Australia.

Master Dao passed away late last year at age 89, and I was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.</p>

The class is rather non-martial, emphasizing connection, ground, and center. From deepening into the practice- how do these principals change and expand? who are you as you fill more space? what does this say about development? Anyone is welcome, and the atmosphere is light hearted.

playa foot ointment - you'll thank us later when your feet don't painfully crack open. or maybe you won't, since you won't have to experience this and won't know just how much it sucks.

electrolytes - why drink boring old water when you can make it SUPER WATER that contains OTHER STUFF YOUR BODY WANTS?

sunscreen - because mom said so.

but wait, we're not commies! you've got to earn your shit here. sing, dance, astound us with your pretentious knowledge, show us how flexible you are, whatever. just do something sweet and we'll call it even.</p>

By holding, rocking, cradling, and mutual movement with each other, a direct path is formed to deep and visceral experiences of nurturance. Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness.

In our workshop circle, we create a sacred space and invite a transmission beyond words that uplifts us from within, and is reflected in the poetry of Life.
Many people live every day identified with an imaginary image of themselves. Wrapped up in that illusory identity, they often fail to see the beauty and perfection in Life, themselves, and Others.

The True Self, which is the essence of Being and Love, is the source of creativity as well. So aligning with our essential nature is a tool for Love and Peace within, and Creativity without. This workshop gives you tools and insight to anchor yourself in your true being and express the Love that you are.</p>

What kind of wise leadership is needed to lead us away from repeating the patterns of our past toward building a new future.  In this panel discussion, explore what the divine feminine can contribute to our evolving world with five clear examples of successful feminine leadership.

You could look at our failing financial and social systems as a global crisis – or you could see that humanity is outgrowing its need for the protective and restrictive infrastructure of the past – and is ready for an ‘upgrade’.

In Humanity 2.0 our panel led by Ibrahim AlHuessini (social entrepreneur and thought leader), will engage in a conversation around one aspect of a possible upgraded geo-political system – that ‘oneness’ is more than a pleasant feeling – but a material value.

        <p class="description">Among Surrealist techniques exploiting the mystique of accident was a kind of collective collage of words or images called the cadavre exquis (exquisite corpse). Based on an old parlor game, it was played by several people, each of whom would write a phrase on a sheet of paper, fold the paper to conceal part of it, and pass it on to the next player for his contribution.
The technique got its name from results obtained in initial playing, "Le cadavre / exquis / boira / le vin / nouveau" (The exquisite corpse will drink the young wine). Other examples are: "The dormitory of friable little girls puts the odious box right" and "The Senegal oyster will eat the tricolor bread." These poetic fragments were felt to reveal what Nicolas Calas characterized as the "unconscious reality in the personality of the group" resulting from a process of what Ernst called "mental contagion."
At the same time, they represented the transposition of Lautréamont's classic verbal collage to a collective level, in effect fulfilling his injunction-- frequently cited in Surrealist texts--that "poetry must be made by all and not by one." It was natural that such oracular truths should be similarly sought through images, and the game was immediately adapted to drawing, producing a series of hybrids the first reproductions of which are to be found in No. 9-10 of La Révolution surrealiste (October, 1927) without identification of their creators. The game was adapted to the possibilities of drawing, and even collage, by assigning a section of a body to each player, though the Surrealist principle of metaphoric displacement led to images that only vaguely resembled the human form.</p>

        <p class="description">Hidden within a few yogic lineages lies a secret knowledge of human sexuality.
At various times institutions arose teaching and practicing sexual divinity. The teachings were vast, powerful, and hidden. The teachings were kept secret due to the ability of people with weak natures to abuse these teachings for selfish gain and reward. This workshop will be revealing teachings which have been hidden for centuries.
This workshop will teach the exercises that courtesans used to train their bodies and energies to remain centered, calm, and untainted by the energy of their lovers.

A gentle and very powerful exercise that today is so important for anyone who wishes to remain in their own personal equilibrium. Whether you are in a committed relationship or have multiple partners these exercises allow you to not absorb the bad moods, afflictions, negative emotions and spiritual imbalances.

These practices were a sort of sexual shield that allowed tantric courtesans to engage in relations with multiple partners ,while remaining open, yet not be affected by the adverse elements within that person.

How important is this in todays world no matter what the manner of relationship you have?

These are practices that you can do on your own which will give you full protection from all negative sexual forces. These practices connect and strengthening the actual pathways of sexual energy in the body, doing that we also used to heal sexual traumas and injuries.

These are not the sexual ecstasy teachings of Tantric sex. These are the foundation exercises upon which those skills are built. There is a big difference. Come out what that difference is.</p>

It is fun, and empowering. Any person of any age, size, color or creed can do it. We explore the ways in which the 5 elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether may assist us in creating a deeper relationship to our Selves, others, and our environment. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work within us, we gain tools that help us to move through life and all of its lessons in a more centered and conscious manner. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community.</p>

Together we will learn a series of different breath practices that you can continue to explore and integrate into your erotic life long after you leave this workshop.
Using breath, sound, and movement, we will bring attention to the erotic energy that our bodies are capable of producing at any given moment. You will learn how to build that energy, increasing it throughout your entire body.
As each of us expands our erotic energy, we will envelop ourselves in a group erotic vibratory force field, which will grow and expand, raising higher and higher, until it peaks into a group energetic orgasm.</p>

Collaborate on lesson plans!  Bring home a slick flyer to prove to your administration that the art festival you missed the first week of school to go to is semi-legitimate!

Registration is at noon on Wednesday; pick up a session listing and check out the break-out board!

All educators are welcome; Early-childhood ed, K-12, higher ed, adult ed, certificated, classified, administrative, whatever!  We all have something to share.</p>

It would be great if you could send an email or register at my facebook event page (https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=266200026739086), so that I can see if enough people are interested (I have to bring some stuff over from Germany!). I hope many Burners will join us! This is for everybody, no experience in any kind of martial art is needed.

Come and feel free to open your hearts to others, find your voice and freedom of expression in a safe and loving environment, connect with other loving, nuturing souls in a private space, dance your heart's joy to beautiful, blissful, spirit-celebrating music. This puja was created by us to be different from any other puja you might have experienced - the emphasis is not on one-on-one rotations, but on a more communal experience - encouraging the energy to be SHARED and then RADIATED out to the PLaya and beyond!! Dress comfortably and bring a blanket or sleeping bag to soften the floor. Bring an open heart to fully benefit from this puja, which will leave you feeling gently awakened, your heart nurtured and your spirit refreshed!</p>

        <p class="description">TANTRIC SHIELDS LEVEL II Hidden within a few yogic lineages lies a secret knowledge of human sexuality. At various times institutions arose teaching and practicing sexual divinity. The teachings were vast, powerful, and hidden. The teachings were kept secret due to the ability of people with weak natures to abuse these teachings for selfish gain and reward. This workshop will be revealing teachings which have been hidden for centuries. This workshop will teach the exercises that courtesans used to train their bodies and energies to remain centered, calm, and untainted by the energy of their lovers. A gentle and very powerful exercise that today is so important for anyone who wishes to remain in their own personal equilibrium. Whether you are in a committed relationship or have multiple partners these exercises allow you to not absorb the bad moods, afflictions, negative emotions and spiritual imbalances. These practices were a sort of sexual shield that allowed tantric courtesans to engage in relations with multiple partners ,while remaining open, yet not be affected by the adverse elements within that person. How important is this in todays world no matter what the manner of relationship you have? These are practices that you can do on your own which will give you full protection from all negative sexual forces. These practices connect and strengthening the actual pathways of sexual energy in the body, doing that we also used to heal sexual traumas and injuries. These are not the sexual ecstasy teachings of Tantric sex. These are the foundation exercises upon which those skills are built. There is a big difference. Come out what that difference is.</p>

We are moving away from the era of the Humpty Dumpty model: put everything back together again before "the event happened". We are finding this model no longer serves us as much as it hinders us from our Soul's Growth. In Re-Organizational Healing we find ourselves embracing " A Rite of Passage" with the experiences that enrich our lives and catapult us from the caterpillar in a cocoon to unleashing our Vitality as the Beautiful Butterfly! What if you knew how to access the gifts of all your "traumatic experiences" and transmute them into Aliveness?! Align your Body-Mind-Soul with enlivening tools to access your most profound sacred gifts to share with the world! It all starts by living in an organized structure that is congruent energetically and utilizes your strengths (gifts) Effortlessly! 

We will be discussing the 5 energetic layers of the body: Life force, Emotional, lower & upper Mental, Soul, Spirit. We will explain how each of these layers relates to the spine and the gifts that each one brings and how you can access these gifts now. We will be giving a demonstration of the work and give you a Somatic Respiratory Integration Exercise to take home with you!</p>

Reinvention is powerful medicine and is not only an opportunity to create dramatic shifts in your personal life, business, or project, but it can also set the stage for a complete life transformation in the direction you want to go. 

This workshop takes participants through their own personal rite of passage ceremony to step powerfully into their next evolution. Participants will write their transformation story, find completion with the past, engage with the creation of a conscious identity, and use the power of group process and a ritualistic container to embrace and embody their future self NOW. 

This is for you if you have been suffering and are ready to let go of the struggle, if you want to become more magnetic, confident and luminous, if you want to step into leadership, or if you simply want to complete a phase of your life and step into the next one in a considered, conscious way. This process assists you with evolving into your vision of your highest self by bringing your future vision into present time so that you may become the person you imagined you could be but didn’t known how to access.</p>

Communication is something that we all take for granted because we have the gift of language and the ability of speech, however, there are countless other modes of communication that we have either forgotten or have been taught to neglect. In this workshop we will discuss how to use every burner’s favorite element (fire) to rediscover some forgotten forms of communication so that we can learn to communicate better with one another, but, more importantly, how to communicate with our planet and the divine. Gaia is calling out to us and she wants to help us, but we need to remember how to hear her voice first- the elements are the gateway!  Other topics include: yoga, meditation, entheogenic shamanism, Native American spirituality/philosophy, green psychology, Buddhism, Gnostic Christianity, twin flames & the soul family concept.</p>

        <p class="description">“Elemental Communication” as presented by Colin Rambo (aka Slug) and Stephanie Smith (aka Firefly). Communication is something that we all take for granted because we have the gift of language and the ability of speech, however, there are countless other modes of communication that we have either forgotten or have been taught to neglect. In this workshop we will discuss how to use every burner’s favorite element (fire) to rediscover some forgotten forms of communication so that we can learn to communicate better with one another, but, more importantly, how to communicate with our planet and the divine. Gaia is calling out to us and she wants to help us, but we need to remember how to hear her voice first- the elements are the gateway! Other topics include: yoga, meditation, entheogenic shamanism, Native American spirituality/philosophy, green psychology, Buddhism, Gnostic Christianity, twin flames & the soul family concept.</p>

Each day of Burning Man at 10:30 a.m., Camp 88 will conduct a chakra-themed, 30-minute yoga session -- from the earthly, grounded energies below, to the spiritual, higher energies above.  Each day will include beautiful ambient music, and will correspond to one chakra: 
- Tuesday: 1st/root chakra; 
- Wednesday: 2nd/sacral chakra; 
- Thursday: 3rd/solar plexus chakra; 
- Friday: 4th/heart chakra; and 
- Saturday: 5th/throat chakra. 

The sessions will culminate in a final, 60- to 75-minute yoga and meditation session that incorporates the themes of the top three chakras: 6th (third eye), 7th (crown) and 8th (aura), centering on enlightenment and transcendence.  This final session will involve about 30 minutes of yoga, followed by about 30 minutes of silent meditation -- all set to intensely moving, deeply satisfying ambient music.</p>

I have found a set of specific techniques that allow for love and acceptance to nourish and fill the body, leaving the body more whole and complete. The beauty of this work is once it is learned and embodied it is a set of skills that the participant can easily carry with them and practice on a regular basis. Through this work we are left with the Spirit and Soul more present and in charge, therefore being more able to be of service to the greater whole. I am a firm believer that we are not truly able to be of service to others until we have healed ourselves.</p>

‘Investigating Tension’ could be the theme of this exercise.  Each of our bodies has its own gait, its own pace and memory.  Our bodies hold a certain preference of movement, a style of movement.  These inherent inclinations in our muscles and nerves can be brought forth into conscious light when our limbs and their range of motion is partially constricted with rope.  New channels of energy can open up in our system when this happens.  New ways of moving and expressing can present themselves.

Rope also contains an inherently erotic element.  This can be fun to play with as well.

Come play and explore.  Have fun.  By yourself---or bound to another.</p>

        <p class="description">"The quickest way to still the mind is to move the body." ~ Gabrielle Roth

The 5Rhythms is an in-bodied, out of your mind  dance experience not to be missed. It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! 

Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion.

The 5Rhythms are:

FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements

STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways

CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated

LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness

STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence

Please join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our sixth year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!</p>

Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion.

        <p class="description">Want to know more about Gabrielle Roth’s 5Rhythms movement practice? Join RhythmWave's Spinnaker (aka Cynthia Kennedy from Olympia Washington) to this 2 hour class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.</p>

        <p class="description">The essence of this elemental, sensational, physical life is body and breath...movement and sound. We will dance and discover the movement and sound of our body, the connection to the elemental world and how this earthly power moves from within, shaping our dance, breath and tone. From here we will merge with the divine spirit already present in and around our being and from this fully empowered sense of self we shall open the 5th chakra fully and give breath to our own true heart song.

Get involved with some of your closest Playa friends and some new friends in trading your old Playa Dust in for a clean body ready to be dusted once again. This event honors your stated boundaries of where you do want to be touched or washed.

You will first participate in helping other Burning Man friends get washed by spraying them with Water, Dr. Bonners Peppermint Soap, washed with plenty of hands by your Playa neighbors, then sprayed again with water and squeeged off before you depart for more Playa fun. Bring a water donation to help the process along.

Hair washing may be available, depending on donated water resources and available PolyParadise members or other Playa friends willing to provide Hair Washing.</p>

We were originally created out of dust and we all eventually return to dust, and dust in the wind is a profound reflection of the human condition. Desert is the site of revelation and the unknown, and it is the liminality where we wander between narrowness and wholeness. We'll look at some texts from the Torah, from the ancient Sages, and from modern Jewish thought. And, together, we'll also look inward and outward in new ways.</p>

When the core muscles are strong and doing their job, as they are trained to do in Pilates, they work in tandem with the more superficial muscles of the trunk to support the spine and movement. Centering, Control, Flow, Breath, Precision, and Concentration: These six Pilates principles are essential ingredients in a high quality Pilates workout. Pilates mat exercises will develop strength, flexibility, coordination and balance.</p>

Grab a cuppa, say hi to Ouroboros and jump aboard the fractal express, a galactic voyage through the archetypes to infinity and back; from mythology to chaos theory. Follow the white rabbit on a journey through the mandalic world of cosmic coincidence, open the door to lady serendipity and invite her in for a pot of freshly brewed synchronici-tea.

Take a stroll into the infinite corridor of chaos and discover the self recursive nature of reality from humans to dark matter. This workshop will unravel the fractal geometry of our universe and allow you to witness the organic structures that grow straight out of the abyss - in the words of Douglas Hofstadter:

“It turns out that an eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind a facade of order - and yet, deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order.”

Just a coincidence? Our lives tend to orchestrate a storyline filled with bizarre synchronicities and connections seemingly beyond explanation, however most are unaware of the extent that our cosmos reflects this characteristic. Ever wondered why the moon and the sun appear to be the same size from Earth? From the atom to the solar system, in this workshop we take a look into the truly unbelievable level of serendipity inherent in our universe.</p>

The yearning for thisSummum Bonum has been described by St. Augustine of old who wrote of god that “our heart is restless until it finds its rest in thee.” Join us as we explore the centrality of Knowledge and Conversation from the perspective of Thelema and how this most sacred of doctrines can impact your life.</p>

What role does spirituality play in terms of appreciating water and human behaviour towards water and environmental stewardship? We will explore and discuss these questions and more together. There will be examples presented from different places around the world (Singapore, San Antonio, TX, Bangladesh, etc...).

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like "gifting," eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world. Many more details are available at: www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 Master Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and one of our campers was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.</p>

Start your evenings with the most intense laughter you can experience. We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

        <p class="description">Want to know more about Gabrielle Roth’s 5Rhythms movement practice? Join guest teacher from Berlin, Germany Dagmar Cee for this 2 hour class and be gently guided through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.

Also explored is the role of mysticism and metaphor in the language of alchemical principles, wherein these descriptions are an allegory for spiritual human transformation as described by C.G. Jung and others. The development of images, art forms, and physical scientific practices is noted, as is the impact of this mystical practice on fields as diverse as medicine, chemistry, and meditation. Please join us for this deep look at alchemy as an idea, an act of art making, and a rebellious act of defiance."</p>

There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann & Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other luminaries held forth. This year we are featuring many visionary talks, community circles, art and performances on subjects such as: the psychedelic experience and research, technological transformation of the human condition and far future, the weird and the strange, and healing plant medicines. 

Bruce Damer, Annie Oak, Robert Forte and many others (TBA) will be joining us for three afternoons of lively sessions which will be held in The Crystal Cavern at Camp Above the Limit. Our schedules are posted daily.

As is our tradition, all sessions will be later broadcast in the Psychedelic Salon podcast.</p>

You cannot NOT watch metal liquify.  It is entrancing to any human being.  The stirring of our glowing orange pot represents the cosmic brew whence we all sprang.

Is Burning Man still cool? How is the 27-year-old event's skyrocketing mainstream appeal changing burner culture? Can Black Rock City, that temporary desert city, really double in size to 100,000 citizens, as its founder envisions? Or is the future of this culture to be found off the playa, in cities around the world? And who will be calling the shots? 
Join Steven T. Jones – the Bay Guardian city editor and author of The Tribes of Burning Man: How an Experimental City in the Desert is Shaping the New American Counterculture – for a lively discussion of how this culture evolved and where it's headed. As one of the few journalists regularly working the Burning Man beat, he offers an inside yet independent perspective on this country's preeminent countercultural institution and its role in modern American life.</p>

We teach tango and blues classes, follow them up with practice time, then happy hour (often with live music), and dances in the evenings.  Tango milongas are Monday and Wednesday, Blues dances on Tuesday and Thursday.

In our classes, you'll learn how to do these two social partner dances, how to connect with the music and your partner, how to relax, you'll get to meet and interact with your playa brethren, and you'll dance a bunch.

During the guided practice time, you'll have a chance to practice during the day and ask questions of the experienced dancers hanging out.

At happy hour, grab a drink, dance and chill. Listen to live music if we have a drop-in musician (or let us know if you you'd like to play some blues or tango music at our camp).

And then in the evening, dress up, and come dance the night away.  We keep the music running at all hours.</p>

Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and live DJ, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free. Dancers tune in to sound and movement to take an inner journey exploring a trancelike state of self-discovery and self-realization.</p>

        <p class="description">Dancing Freedom is a practice of liberation and embodied awakening. It is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance practice supporting the emergence of living oneness. It is fun, engaging and empowering. It heals. It reveals. It welcomes. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community. We gather in ceremony to dance an elemental wave through earth, water, fire, air and ether to reclaim, transform & express the totality of who and what we are. The five Elements are the building blocks of our world as well as alchemical keys to the mystery of divine co-creation.  In learning to attune to the elements we can harmonise the inner and outer dimensions of our experience and open to the depths and mystery of the sacred dance of life. As we invoke these primordial forces, they awaken the dreamer within who can assist us to create a deeper relationship to our Selves, others and our environment.  Engaging our body, mind and emotions within the relational field is an active and imaginative process that opens the gateways of consciousness for real-time remembrance of our multi dimensional wholeness and unity.</p>

To feel healthy and whole we connect with and manifest the visions of our essence.  

Join Alex Grey and Allyson Grey for this experiential happening.
Vision practices lend access to a glimpse of the interplay of body and sou

God is the divine artist and the universe is the continually evolving masterpiece of creation.  -- Alex Grey

Creativity is an evolving cosmic force, the spark that activates inspired action. Realization and alignment with our source activates and empowers our channels of cosmic creativity. Pyramids, ancient stone circles, and temples were all built by armies of creators in alignment with heaven and earth. Uniting with the nature-field expands the identity of the individual beyond the bounds of body and ego, realizing the cosmic Self in Oneness with Collective Consciousness. The unitive mystical experience is the basis of all religions. Explore visionary culture through the lens of cosmic creativity and consider how the aesthetic experience of art can be a magnifying glass through which we appreciate life.</p>

        <p class="description">Indulge in this challenging, informative, spontaneous, and worshipful experience with Uma, celebrated by New York Magazine as one of NYC's top 5 fitness gurus. Open to all levels.
 
About Uma
 
A life-long belief of "to know it is to live it" found Uma at the doorstep of the famed NYC Jivamukti Yoga Studio of Sharon Gannon and David life. 1997's top grad turned teacher-training director, began to cultivate her roots. Saraswati's "serial chants" and "deft sermons" quickly soared globally as both U.S. and French edition Marie Claire magazines began to pick up on her message.
 
As the foremost Senior Advanced Certified Jivamukti Yoga Teacher, Saraswati mentored hundreds of students. Devotees and apprentices have gone on to open successful yoga studios nationwide.
 
Spiritual master, Shree Maa, initiated Uma into the ceremonial rites of puja worship. Her name Nanda Saraswati, The Goddess of Bliss, was then bestowed.
 
Through intense workshops and rehabilitative knowledge, Uma teaches the authentic experience of becoming your Self. In her pocket she carries a toolkit of ancient teachings: knowledge of Sanskrit language, performance of ceremonial worship, kirtan chanting (5-year tour with famed wallah bhagavan das), meditation, bhakti, and karma yoga studies. Over the years, Uma has had a host of long-standing, high profile, private clients.
 
Uma’s belief that you can't read life, you have to become life; moves you into the depths of your being, so you can peace out. 
 
When she is not teaching yoga in downtown NYC, she is ecstatically chanting the name of God in bliss-filled, rock the house, get up and dance kirtans with Lokah.

This workshop builds on the discoveries and theories on a quantum role for the entheogenic experience that I presented in my book "Tryptamine Palace: 5-MeO-DMT and the Sonoran Desert Toad", by integrating ancient and modern ideas on the role of the Ego in consciousness. We will examine how entheogen use can cast a light on some of the most ancient and perplexing questions of the role of the Ego in our lives; and how the Ego creates our Society and technology, and how our modern view of the role of the Ego - in both our lives and our Society - will shape the future we will all live.</p>

In this presentation, Jamie Janover will take you on a journey through humanity’s evolution, exposing the changes necessary to produce a Unified Physics; a unification of not only the forces of nature but also the occurrence of consciousness, one which also reveals emerging parallels between ancient codes left in documents and monuments with the most modern day advanced scientific ideas.

        <p class="description">I became interested in how the shamans utilized sound, chant and music to guide and affect trance states as well as healing. I practiced as a healer at our center (www.bluemorphotours.com), specializing in using ayahuasca and sound to heal depression and generate transcendent experience of consciousness. http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/0603/features/peru.html 4 years ago I started to branch out from ayahuasca and sought to bring the unique qualities of ayahuasca shamanism to music. I wanted to use the music to guide trance states induced by the music. The theory was to guide people to heart, love and direct spiritual or transcendent experience without being told where or how to go. The music itself would guide through the mix of sounds. I started a music partnership with my wife Wendy, who is a 15 year opera, choir and rock singer to create the music. The mix of her traditional musical training with my traditional shamanic training allowed for the right combination to make the music possible.We blended the musical structure found in the shamanism to existing electronic genres like World Music and House. The music itself is electronic with vocals sung by Wendy and me.As for the burn, we have three distinct types of music we could perform. The first would be the chants and icaros of traditional amazonian shamanism (leading ceremonies for groups of people), the second would be to perform our world music and the third, our house music. In addition, lectures on ayahuasca shamanism and the traditional uses of ayahuasca, how it is practiced, apprenticeship, working with elders and the modern uses of ayahuasca for healing.  In addition I created a project called Modern Shamanism designed to create a unique form of shamanic/spiritual exploration for Modern people based out of modern life experience. I could lead trances/meditations through this practice. www.modernshamanism.org</p>

This discussion is about distilling the tools of religions from the dogmas that surround them. (Don't don't throw out the baby with the holy water!) Rather than trying to cover this whole topic in a single workshop, the goal will be to introduce the general concepts while facilitating the sharing of resources (books, articles, quotes, etc.) for people to explore on their own.

Ground, Flow, Activate, Fly and Expand as we access elemental centers within our very own body. As a community we create a safe container for the dance to unfold and for our individual souls to be seen within the greater context of the collective unit, embodying oneness through movement. When our bodies, minds and spirits come together in a cohesive way, we reach and co-create subtle layers of auric and energetic evolution while still remaining in our own soul-matic expression; together, as one.</p>

        <p class="description">One of the most historically influential decades, the 1960s came and went, taking with them the ideologies of consciousness exploration, active environmentalism and true freedom until now.  After over 40 years of dormancy, a new revolution has emerged, taken shape, revealed its face and resonated a strong voice to guide the global community.

Mitch Schultz and Charles Shaw share their new feature length documentary that focuses the lens at the nexus of this next-generation mystical revival.  The growing worldwide community of like minds continues to grow and intentionally gather to celebrate life and create positive change on the planet.  The project takes the pulse of the culture at transformational festivals around the world in 2012, including Symbiosis, Lightning in a Bottle, Desert Rocks, Sonic Bloom, Boom, Burning Man, Australia’s Eclipse 2012 and Belize Solstice 2012, and many more.  With the backdrop of these amazing festivals and communicated through the individual festival participants, we explore a variety of different themes, including activism, art, consciousness, environmentalism, music, mythology, technology, and 2012 as a general framework to better understand and define the culture.

We are designed to be living conduits of fundamental creative energy streaming forth and manifesting into form.  The question is, how much are we impeding or allowing these vital currents to move and dance their way through us in each moment?  When we dissolve the inevitable veneers accumulated from our societal conditioning, we find at the core an inherently ecstatic nature.  Often touched upon inconsistently in fleeting moments of unification, it beckons us forth as a song calling us home.  Discover how to get out of your own way, dissolving resistance and accessing this essential core in order to ecstatically birth the fullness of each moment from a state of pure presence.</p>

We shall provide the space for you to dive deeper in to your dance and to develop an intimate relationship with each of the 5 elements. Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether are the building blocks of the created Universe through which we EMBODY. As we work with and through each element they gift us with full spectrum expression and experience, full spectrum transformation and full spectrum return to wholeness. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work within us, we gain tools that help us to move through life and all of its lessons in a more centered and conscious manner. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community.</p>

In this 2.5 hour workshop, students are facilitated to the discovery of their very own myofascial restrictions, and guided on how to release them. This is where the magic happens. This is the shift begins.

Ashley and Bryon work on an individual level to isolate the physical and emotional blockages that restrict us from achieving our full potential in each yoga posture. This revolutionizing approach to understanding the body will propel you years ahead in your yoga practice. Forget the eons of prep classes; you can meet your goals overnight. Revolutionized Yoga is the optimal solution for yoga practitioners that are craving a real, a rapid, a wild and a drastic shift in their yoga practice and their life.

Taught by Ashley Holly, MA, RYT and Bryon Brewster, CST, BCSI, MT, CHN, Osteopath, this workshop explores and shares the linkages between the connective tissue, fascia, movement and the asana.</p>

        <p class="description">Self expression is cool: flailing, head banging and stochastic gyration is all good fun. But communication is hard if our self expression is not understood. This class aims to cut to the chase and help you build your own vocabulary that reflects you, while imposing as little orthodox structure on your creativity as possible. Where most dance lessons focus on the vocabulary of dance, in this class you will have the opportunity to explore the phonemes of dance. These are the small bits that can be assembled into dance moves, just like we assemble phonemes into words that can be understood by others. Understanding these concepts renders the need to distinguish between one style/vocabulary and another far less important and makes the fusion of many styles and techniques much, much easier. It's like being able to read the phonetic alphabet, or seeing the green lines of binary code behind the Matrix. 

So here's how it works: We're going to start off with a half an hour or so of these kinetic phonemes (little bits) and we're going to splice in some practice dances to solidify the concepts. Then your teachers are going to to DJ a set using some of the music you've practiced with and employing a playlist designed to illustrate how the social dances can be adapted to a wide variety of cool stuff. So cool in fact, that you will probably want to write down and download when you get home. (or you will experience a rush of feel-good chemicals because you're already familiar with such cool music and that will make you feel cool even though your self-perception is an illusion of your temporal brain chemistry.) During this dance, you may ask your teachers and any other veteran social dancers who may be attending for advice and technique. There won't be any dance etiquette at play here and the next scheduled dance that follows may well be in the nude, so relax, get over yourself and let's have fun.</p>

It turns out that the amount of time it takes a group of strangers to solve an unexpected problem is directly related to its diversity.  Completely homogenous groups failed to get out of their elevator at all, while the most diverse groups escaped in a few minutes.  This points to what we know intuitively to be true which is the cross fertilization of ideas, methodologies, and perspectives is essential to solving the biggest problems facing humanity today.</p>

        <p class="description">There is an unlimited or nearly unlimited supply of everything we could need or want (water, food, love, value, sex, happiness).  The single biggest obstacle between us and living in a world where this is apparent to everyone is the meme of scarcity and our belief in its existence.  For those of us on the edge of truly surrendering to an abundance mindset, truly walking through the world as fully resourced people, how do we take the last few steps for ourselves and each other?  This panel discusses pragmatic methods of transferring from scarcity to abundance in any context for ourselves and those around us.</p>

        <p class="description">Nothing new can emerge without first a coming together. Creation -- in all of its infinite forms -- requires an encounter: of people, of materials, of ideas. Everything was born of relations -- of chemistry and community, of labor and love. Every single thing.

This simple truth poses important questions: For if everything is born from a cauldron of relations -- from whence comes the spark? And might not some types of relations prove more an obstacle to creativity than its fertile soup? Answers to these questions could in turn help us to answer perhaps the most important question of all: How can we create a more creative world?

On Thursday August 30, 2012, TEDxBlackRockCity seeks to investigate the nature of creativity and possibilities of its fluorescence.</p>

Dancing Freedom is a practice of liberation and embodied awakening. It is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance practice supporting the emergence of living oneness. It is fun, engaging and empowering. It heals. It reveals. It welcomes. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community. We gather in ceremony to dance an elemental wave through earth, water, fire, air and ether to reclaim, transform & express the totality of who and what we are.

The five Elements are the building blocks of our world as well as alchemical keys to the mystery of divine co-creation. In learning to attune to the elements we can harmonise the inner and outer dimensions of our experience and open to the depths and mystery of the sacred dance of life. As we invoke these primordial forces, they awaken the dreamer within who can assist us to create a deeper relationship to our Selves, others and our environment. Engaging our body, mind and emotions within the relational field is an active and imaginative process that opens the gateways of consciousness for real-time remembrance of our multi dimensional wholeness and unity.</p>

What many Kundalini Yoginis know from their own practice is actually beginning to emerge into the annals of Academic research and we are going to spend an afternoon diving right into Yoga as Medicine for Kundalini practitioners.

with transparent communication creating a safe space of intensity that
will allow participants to become aware and explore shadow elements in
the personality. These shadows are unconscious elements that are
preventing greater intimacy in relationships and affecting all aspects
of life. Shadows can create an inability to be fully Authentic with
people. Two major symptoms of shadow elements are both Anxiety and
Depression. Shadow Work addresses the real underlying causes instead
of the symptoms that manifest. Most often it is an uncomfortableness
with vulnerability occurring during development that created an
unconscious shielding and protecting of the Heart. This workshop will
give the awareness practices to become aware of Shadow Elements and
inspiration to integrate them. The benefits of this work if done with
a Willingness to Open is a richer fuller life.</p>

We'll help you diagnose everything right down to your plumbing and if it's broke, we'll either fix it or toss you into our voodoo fertility lottery. If on the other hand you suspect your junk works too well and you want it broke, we're absolutely the right people to help you break it. We normally fix bikes and nuclear reactors, but we're branching out a bit this year with the theme and all. Wire snippers, soldering irons, hot glue guns and alcohol will be provided.</p>

        <p class="description">Join us for an experiential dance journey held in the vibrancy of the 5 Rhythms, SheddingSkins and Dancing Freedom movement practices.

We will begin by discovering our sensual expression slowly from the inside...finding that center point of self-love and self-care and allowing it to grow from our heart center out into the physical, exploring from fingertips to belly to toes how to cultivate this feeling inside while inviting it to be present outside. 

From here we will reveal how to extend that dance to the space around us and (always in clear choice, never pushing beyond out own place of 'yes') then how to connect it with others, discovering how connecting affects our own dance, that of another and of the space between us...how to honor and care for self, invite sensual expression with others and allow each to be witnessed and held in that sweet dance of our authentic self which is ever connected, rooted and free.

Do you have lots of creative ideas but have trouble bringing any of them to any fruition? Do you jump from one creative project to the next without any sensing any unifying thread? Drawing upon Vajrayana (Tantric) Buddhism, Jungian psychology, Neurolinguistic Programming, and an experiential journey through the 7 chakras, this interactive talk will explore the nature of creativity and its obstacles, and use those obstacles as catalysts to uncover your innate capacity to create.</p>

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion.</p>

Toprock is the foremost opening display of style and introduction to any move.

Footwork is movement on the floor with hands supporting the dancer as much as the feet involving variations using knees and threading limbs.

Freezes are stylish poses suspending the off the ground using upper body strength. It is often signaled the completion of one's set.

Power moves are acrobatic moves that require momentum, speed, endurance, strength, and control creating circular momentum. (advanced)

Flavor is about combining all the elements, learning musicality, and developing one's own style.

It turns out that the amount of time it takes a group of strangers to solve an unexpected problem is directly related to its diversity.  Completely homogenous groups failed to get out of their elevator at all, while the most diverse groups escaped in a few minutes.  This points to what we know intuitively to be true which is the cross fertilization of ideas, methodologies, and perspectives is essential to solving the biggest problems facing humanity today.

This panel discusses pragmatic methods of transferring from scarcity to abundance in any context for ourselves and those around us.

        <p class="description">Nothing new can emerge without first a coming together. Creation - in all of its infinite forms - requires an encounter: of people, of materials, of ideas. Everything was born of relations - of chemistry and community, of labor and love. Every single thing.

This simple truth poses important questions: if everything is born from a cauldron of relations — from whence comes the spark? And might not some types of relations prove more an obstacle to creativity than its fertile soup? Answers to these questions could in turn help us to answer perhaps the most important question of all: How can we create a more creative world?

On Thursday August 30, 2012, TEDxBlackRockCity seeks to investigate the nature of creativity and possibilities of its fluorescence.

Black Rock City — or Burning Man — the largest intentional community on earth, and one of the world’s most vibrantly creative places, will provide an especially powerful setting for this investigation. On its most basic level, TEDxBlackRockCity will provide a stage for some of Burning Man’s most visionary inhabitants to speak about their ideas and their creations. On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.

Indeed, it is in the spirit of three of these Principles: Inclusion, Communality and Participation, that TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants — both on stage and off — drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.

TEDxBlackRockCity will take place on August 30, 2012 at 1PM, located at Play)A(Skool —9:45 & Esplanade.</p>

        <p class="description">Balance is more than keeping your center of gravity over your foundation, it is also an inquiry into feeling and responding.  Linking breath with movement through a variety of guided yoga postures, we will play with fun balancing poses, and explore the experience of finding balance from within in this invigorating vinyasa yoga class.</p>

        <p class="description">Fertility is creation. Being grounded is a huge step towards achieving a more fruitful, balanced, creative, and loving life. whether it's daily stresses from work, the relationships in our lives, or many other variables that our mind occupies itself with, often we lose track of our path because we get too caught up. we lose our groundedness. this means more than just being rooted into the earth i.e. feeling secure. groundedness is a connection that our mind, body and spirit has to earth, to the universe, and to each other. when this connection becomes stronger, distractions and stresses no longer slow us down. what really matters to you becomes clear and letting go of that which does not serve you becomes easier and easier. this 60 minute class will use different techniques from chi, pranayama, and meditation to achieve higher ground and enlightenment!</p>

The Palenque Norte Speaker Series is a series of lectures focused on altered states of consciousness, psychedelic medicines, and the mystical experience. We will be returning to the Burning Man festival for the first time since 2007, and need your help to make this happen. We’ve put together an amazing schedule of 22 speakers across 4 days which include luminaries such as Alex and Allyson Grey, Paul Stamets, Daniel Pinchbeck, Rick Doblin and many more. The talks will hosted by Camp Above the Limit and be located in the Crystal Cavern, a 40’ dome at 9:15 & B. 

Check out the full schedule and audio from past lectures at: http://www.matrixmasters.com/pn/ 

Palenque Norte History

The Palenque Norte journey began with the legendary Entheobotany Conferences held at the Chan Kah hotel near the ancient Mayan ruins just outside of Palenque, Mexico. There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann & Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other psychedelic luminaries passed along many insights, discoveries, and wild tales to the fortunate Tribe members who were there. And it was at the end of the pool where Terence McKenna gave some of his last talks at the Chan Kah.

Years later, then in 2003, a few alumni from those conferences decided to have a "Palenque reunion" at the Burning Man Festival, and so we organized a theme camp and lecture series to continue the Palenque tradition.</p>

Every part is necessary for the creation of the world we are ushering in. We will dance an elemental wave through earth, water, fire, air and ether to heal, transform & embody our most highly empowered selves, allowing us to more actively engage with this rapidly shifting world from a centered, grounded place. 

Dancing Freedom is a practice of liberation and embodied awakening. It is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance practice supporting the emergence of living oneness. It is fun, easy, elegant and empowering. It heals. It reveals. It welcomes. Any person of any age, size, color or creed can do it. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community. We come together in ceremony to dance an elemental wave through earth, water, fire, air and ether to heal, transform & embody our awakening.</p>

Audrey Katherine, PhD will be presenting her dissertation research which used qualitative and intuitive inquiry research methods to explore the types of transpersonal phenomena that people experience at electronic dance music (EDM) events and how these experiences integrate into day-to-day life. Twelve participants were interviewed and a thematic content analysis was conducted on the data, revealing the following overarching themes: Interpersonal relationships with the numinous, spiritual beings, and human beings are fostered; occurrence of transformative intrapersonal experiences; electronic dance music and its effects on the mind and body serve as a catalyst for experiences of transpersonal phenomena; experiences of a spiritual and mystical nature transpire; emphasis placed on the significance of set and setting. Findings suggest that having experiences of transpersonal phenomena at EDM events enhances health and wellbeing in day-to-day life.</p>

        <p class="description">Holotropic Breathwork™ is a powerful approach to self-exploration and healing that integrates insights from modern consciousness research, anthropology, various depth psychologies, transpersonal psychology,
Eastern spiritual practices, and mystical traditions of the world. The
name Holotropic means literally "moving toward wholeness" (from the
Greek "holos"=whole and "trepein"=moving in the direction of something).

The process itself uses very simple means: it combines accelerated
breathing with evocative music in a special set and setting. With the
eyes closed and lying on a mat, each person uses their own breath and
the music in the room to enter a non-ordinary state of consciousness.
This state activates the natural inner healing process of the
individual's psyche, bringing him or her a particular set of internal experiences. With the inner healing intelligence guiding the process,
the quality and content brought forth is unique to each person and for
that particular time and place. While recurring themes are common, no
two sessions are ever alike.</p>

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence Please join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our seventh year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!</p>

        <p class="description">Medicine Dance is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance ceremony that supports the emergence of liberation, interconnectivity and embodied awareness as we move through the fullness of our human experiences. It's fun, empowering and accessible to people - all that is required is curiosity & a willingness to explore one's inner terrain through movement.
Using movement, we work with the 5 elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether as allies to access the unique Medicine that is encoded within each of us and create a deeper relationship to our Selves, Others, and LIFE. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work, we gain tools that help us to move through life in a more centered & conscious manner, embracing the shifting currents as exactly the Medicine we need for our healing, growth and expansion into the fullness of our lives. We come together peacefully to create a deep space of exploration, safety, shared practice, transformation and community.</p>

You've travelled to the ends of the Earth, cast aside your default life, and willingly peered over the Edge. Now what?

(Nothing but) Flowers is a seminar devoted to the propagation of Burning Man core principles in the default world. In keeping with this years theme of the "Cargo Cult" we will discuss situations in which small populations of subjugated people have maintained their beliefs in the face of hegemonic reprogramming efforts. As such, we will discuss the role of the individual in changing the default world to reflect the best of what the Burn represents via various methods of culture jamming and activism.

(Nothing but) Flowers a Talking Heads song, and meme for this discussion can be heard immediately following this event @DC not Washington Talking Heads dance party!</p>

This year,  we'll be going out each morning with Friends of Black Rock volunteers as both LNT advisors and cultural ambassadors with BLM.  It's a great opportunity to have 'boots on the ground' and share LNT love.  Volunteers will all be getting lunch after each morning shift. (starting at 8:30am-noon).</p>

        <p class="description">This 2 hour class will gently guide you through each of the rhythms: flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness. Each rhythm focuses on a simple movement quality rather than a specific form or set of steps, giving everyone the freedom to move in ways that feel authentic without any pressure to get it right. With a little instruction, the experience of the 5Rhythms opens us deeply and helps us move beyond self-consciousness to an authentic connection to our body and life force. Using the discipline of each rhythm and the breath as a catalyst for movement, you will be invited to embody, follow, express, and release your own energy. In the end, you will find yourself renewed and reconnected to your own self, feeling fully alive.</p>

Take a walk through your house (or Burning Man camp) from plastic-packaged food in the kitchen to toothbrushes and shampoo in the bathroom, our world is full of plastic.  And at Burning Man, we are sleep in plastic sleeping bags in plastic tents and wear plastic goggles.  And how much of our food and water is packaged in plastic? Although some plastics make our lives better, much of it is a problem -- polluting our oceans and beaches and harming our health with toxic chemicals. But what can one person do to be part of the solution? Join us for inspiring stories and practical tips to reduce plastic in your home and on the Playa.  Author Beth Terry will share her journey from self-confessed plastic addict to empowered plastic-free activist and explain why we can't just recycle our way out of this mess.  You may even get to peek at her (nearly) plastic-free campsite.</p>

        <p class="description">At this workshop psychotherapist Meriana Dinkova will introduce some important factors to consider when navigating altered states of consciousness. She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world. Through lecture, sharing, and experiential exercises she will enrich your psychonaut- toolkit, and activate and empower your inner shaman.</p>

The biggest news is the ongoing Uranus - Pluto square, which is coming up again in early November. The revolutionary and evolutionary symbolism of this collision of outer planet energies is evidenced all around us, for both the society in general and for individuals. It represents in fact the hallmark of the sixties, when they were last in major aspect; then they were conjunct. Coincidentally - not! - the first exact hit if this current square was last year, in 2012... we have been seeing increasing signs of the return of sixties idealism and sexual freedom, women's empowerment, folks out in the streets to protest an establishment that has truly run amok, and on and on... this important outer planet aspect in fact colors this entire decade that I like to call the "turbulent teens..."

You're probably NOT meditating! Or at least, you're not being told what is NOT meditation! For centuries, techniques that have been used successfully on eastern type folks seem to be falling flat in The West, and there are some questions you may not have asked, or had answered. Join Zyg, a veteran of Not Meditating, for a talk and workshop on How Not to Meditate. Mediation cannot be discussed, but only experienced.. Zyg hopes to steer you into an authentic understanding of Meditation, and of sitting, standing, or whatever else you may be doing that is not meditation. Especially Meditation.</p>

It comprises a new somatic modality for reanimating the body with its improvisatory flow and playful exploratory freedom. Supported on a massage table with your body borne aloft on the continually moving fulcrum of the practitioner’s body, the receiver is moved through a wide range of extended postures.  Using a suite of practiced movements, such as pivoting his body under different joints of your body, the giver is able to move the receiver seamlessly and weightlessly throughout the course a session. He safely levers the receiver’s body into increasingly extended and pleasurable positions that combine deep hip opening, pivoting and spinal decompression that, collectively, evoke a deep state of surrender.</p>

NOW YOU CAN!

Come earn your clown nose at Circus Boot Camp. You've seen feats of skill on the Playa, and who hasn't dreamed of running off to join the Circus. Heck, half of y'all probably still dream in acrobats and clowns.  At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts.

I know what you're thinking: "Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed).

Already a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!</p>

The mystery and beauty of what I have termed "psychedelic rationalism" will be discussed using the lens of gender. This is a new way of thinking about women's participation and contributions to psychedelic culture, and introduces the idea of a blended rationalist paradigm of psychedelic knowledge. Far from essentialist assumptions that men are from Mars and women are from Venus, this talk will discuss the sociology of male/female cooperation, knowledge, experience, and community-building in psychedelic circles. What emerges is a new paradigm for understanding inner-action/interaction.</p>

This talk is an invigorating and inspiring synthesis of scientific discoveries, shamanic techniques, communications with animal, plant, planetary intelligence and transcending the "Other" with empathy as primary toolkit for understanding the biology and consciousness of different sentient organisms. Tapping into the ability of shamans to imagine themselves imbuing the traits of animals has been a valuable way for a consciousness to expand itself beyond its biological parameters as we reach the apex of the ecological collapse, and realize the potential to unlock new horizons of what it means to be human in a post human identity culture.</p>

        <p class="description">This is a presentation that narrates a personal healing process through the use of entheogenic agents. These agents provided the transcendent space that allowed inner wounds to be reconfigured into a more manageable and workable form, releasing the soul from inner/outer conflict.

Experiences with three different entheogenic agents enabled me to access states of consciousness that fostered healing in my familial relationships by re-framing conflicts, through form of visions and wider understandings, in pictorial, mythological, and transcendent narratives. These experiences in the Other Worlds have been translated into substantial and concrete shifts in the Ordinary World.

This journey through the ‘immaterial' considers entheogenic agents as psychological/emotional catalysts for transformation and growth. The Jungian framework of alchemy and individuation has been central in filtering my transformational process and the focus is on its relevance to integrating psychedelic explorations.</p>

        <p class="description">There is nothing more basic intimate connection you can have with another person than touch. There are things which can be erotic, silly, or basic than the touch that leads to tickling. Tickling is a great way to explore a new avenue of fun and intimacy with your partner. It can be light, it can be soft, or it can be heavy and sadistic. 

We will cover many aspects of tickling from playing with others, simple bondage techniques, wrestling, common toys you can use to make your partner cry out in fits of laughter, to discussions of how it can spice up your sex life.  We will cover some aspects of BDSM for the full spectrum of tickling fun.  In addition we will cover the proper etiquette for playing with someone new to you.


 There will also have a tickle challenge for the most ticklish man and woman attending the event. Those two will be tickled by our event  coordinators, the partner, and whomever else the person is comfortable with. The person who lasts the longest of tickle torment will win a cool prize and be crowned tickle king or queen of Black Rock City.

You must be 18 years of age or older to attend this event. This event is best suited for those with a partner. If you do not have a partner that does not mean you cannot attend. We cannot guarantee you will have a partner to play with, but we will try and match you up with someone or one of our instructors.


Do be respectful of others and their boundaries. Just remember we are all here for fun, and we have at least two things in common. We are interested/curious about tickling and we are all burners.</p>

Pairs of dancers form a circle, with dance moves called out by one person, a caller. Many moves involve the swapping of partners creating a fun, synchronized, playful community circle dance.</p>

We laugh for no reason, other than for exercise, and health. Relieve  
stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds  
of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr.  
Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter  
Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama).  
Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or  
comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye  
contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and  
contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a  
scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and  
real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological  
benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga,  
but come! Enjoy!</p>

It should be thought of as more of a form of object manipulation, like juggling.
  We'll have one wall for throwing at and a floor board for familiarizing yourself with the weight and balance of the knives. Between classes when we're at our teepee and not wandering around experiencing the wonders of Burning Man we'll be available for more knife throwing fun.

Musicians, enthusiasts, roadies, visionaries, and realists are all welcome to talk about how to bring Beethoven to the playa.

        <p class="description">TEDxBlackRockCity is a one-day event (August 29, 2013) of talks and performances around this years theme:  Paradigm - Shift.

Our speakers and performers reflect a wide variety of the creative dimensions of Black Rock City, a temporary city of over 50,000 people formed in the Nevada desert once a year to celebrate art and creative freedom.

Black Rock City — or Burning Man — the largest intentional community on earth, and one of the world’s most vibrantly creative places, will provide an especially powerful setting for this investigation. 

On its most basic level, TEDxBlackRockCity will provide a stage for some of Burning Man’s most visionary inhabitants to speak about their ideas and their creations. On a deeper level, it will draw on the very values of Burning Man, whose Ten Principles (radical inclusion, gifting, de-commodification, radical, self-reliance, radical self-expression, communal effort, civic responsibility, leaving no trace, participation, and immediacy) will provide touchstones for the speakers in their talks.

Indeed, it is in the spirit of the 10 Principles, TEDxBlackRockCity aims to be more than merely a staged performance. For it is intended, above all, to foster creativity among all of its remarkable participants — both on stage and off — drawing on the uniquely dynamic community of Burning Man to concoct an exemplar of that fertile soup churning with creative sparks.

Please join us for an exciting day at Play)A(Skool and the new Aspire "Learning Center" --- a collaborative interactivity zone created by Play)A(Skool, IDEATE and La Calaca.</p>

We're going to do it anyways. On a camp stove, with a pot that's too small. By the end of the class, you'll have gone through the process; you'll know how to brew beer! Will you remember by the time you get home? Fat chance.

Barring disaster, it'll be fermented, carbonated, and kegged by the end of the week. Drinkable? We'll see.

This workshop is a challenge to the theme that Cargo Cult is all about aliens, visitors returning, and celebrating John Frum. Come join in an interactive workshop that will explore the shadow side of John Frum including the negative impact of colonialism, the glorification of material objects, the destruction of native lands and culture, America's lack of responsibility for military endeavors, and the current impact of this Cargo Cult story. This workshop will explore our shared reality of how racism, classism, and sexism affect our current Burning Man community. We welcome people of all backgrounds to this workshop and to this exploration of how the oppression we were taught in every day society plays out on playa. We will explore the difficulties of the current paradigm and how that affects our ability to form a new experimental community. There will be space to address how we as the BM community want to create change on and off playa.</p>

        <p class="description">This offering will be a combination of lecture and dialogue on the topic of open (non-monogamous) relationship as a path of awakening. Open relationships, and/or polyamory, are becoming more widely known to the general public as an alternative to the default cultural model of monogamous relationships. One of the first questions that comes up for someone when they first hear about open relationship is "Why?" Why would anyone choose this model of relationship? Certainly at the beginning of someone's exploration of open relationship (and often for sometime to come), it would seem a guaranteed way to bring up ones deepest fears and insecurities. So why do it? 

We will talk about open relationships and explore answers to these questions, from an unlikely frame, that of spiritual awakening. In my opinion, not only is open relationship compatible with a deep path of spiritual awakening, it may be one of the most profound ways to catalyze and walk that path.</p>

Britt Fohrman fell in love with yoga in 1993 and has been teaching since 1997. While her foundation is rooted in the Iyengar lineage, a 10 year struggle with chronic illness inspired her to go deeply into Restorative Yoga, Viniyoga and Buddhism. Having studied therapeutic yoga and movement with many of the leaders in the field, Britt still believes it's her own healing journey, as well as that of her students, that has taught her the most. Along with her steadfast belief in the healing power of yoga, Britt brings resourcefulness and warmth to her classes. Her style of teaching emphasizes individualized alignment, meditative focus and breath guided movement; imbued with levity, compassion and honesty. She encourages you to step out of your head, into your body and on a yoga journey that supports you wherever you are. One of Britt's specialties lies in working with childbearing women, where she also employs her talents as a photographer, doula, childbirth educator and bodyworker. A passionate adventurer and athlete, Britt spends most of her free time traveling, surfing, hiking with her dog and dancing with the performance art group Billion Jelly Bloom. (Who she's camping and performing with on the Playa)

Learn the secret lost in the Garden of Eden that money grows on trees. It is the secret hidden from us by the serpent viper money changers. Learn how to destroy all fiat currency and turn it into gods money. Time, technology and resource based currencies.

Learn how you can convert your fiat currency into food based currency thus returning the fiat to the bankers who printed it and leaving you with an actual valuable commodity to spend into the economy.

Its simple you purchase a bag of grain from a local producer only they agree to store it for you and you get the receipt to trade for other goods or services. Now you have a pure resource based currency. It has more intrinsic value than fiat as it can be eaten. 

The receipt for the goods must be claimed by a certain date to be valid as the product has a shelf life and the grower storing the grain has to pay for storage. The receipt has the value of the grain paid in dollars and denotes the weight the receipt is good for.
The receipt can be traded for the fiat currency value or the weight value.

In this way any agricultural community can regain control of their money supply.

May peace be with you,

As educators, we all bring so much back to our classrooms from the playa. The goal of BREC is to create a staff development opportunity unlike any other- where we help each other to bring the magic home to our students. All educators are welcome; Early-childhood ed, K-12, higher ed, adult ed, certificated, classified, administrator or school board member, all are welcome! We all have something to share. 

Teach a breakout session! Collaborate on lesson plans! Bring home a slick flyer to share with your fellow educators!  Pick up a session listing and check out the break-out board! Can't make it to registration? Join us when you arrive.</p>

We will provide some fun decorating items and a place for you to record that 'special' bad decision you made in the past or are planning on making at Burning Man! Keep your bear as a memento or release yourself from the consequences of your bad decisions by burning both at The Temple on Sunday. Bring your bear, if you have one (or use one of ours), along with your creativity to the 'edge' of Cheezy Porn on Wed, Thur and Friday from 4pm to 6pm.

This is an introduction to the amazingly effective, simple and ground-breaking work of Jon Connelly in restoring victims of severe trauma, including sexual violence and war veterans, to full function. (See rapidtrauma.com for more information).

 

The morning workshop will outline the content of an average session, and explain the principles at work that allow for rapid resolution. Attendees will benefit personally by tapping into the human mind’s power to heal and restore proper function after trauma – which is defined as anything stored in the human mind in a dysfunctional way.

 

The afternoon session will ask for volunteers to do a session, free of charge, with an audience observing. Life-changing, all will gain insights that will benefit them in their life and lead to a brighter, lighter, more peaceful and exciting life.

 

Class is taught by David Monroe, who has been a “scout” of healing technologies for years, and is certified in Rapid Trauma Resolution training.</p>

Most forms of energy healing, such as Reiki, utilize the energy of manifested life. However, Vortex makes use of divine light and energy, which is more powerful, and can work more deeply, than the energy of manifested life alone. Vortex utilizes 49 different kinds of divine light that serve various functions, including energizing, clearing, purifying, releasing, etc. Finally, all of these forms of divine light are guided by divine consciousness, which brings the deepest power of transformation, i.e. healing separation consciousness. 

This workshop will feature two Omega-level practitioners of VortexHealing® Divine Energy Healing who will facilitate a small group healing on a topic to be determined at the time of the workshop. Space will be limited to about 15 people.</p>

There is an ancient code about the energetic nature of the Earth preserved in volcano mythology, which defines a global grid of sacred geometry whose symbolism reflects the legends themselves. These new maps of our planet connect pyramids, stone circles, mysterious sites, powerful cities, and geologic wonders around the world, giving us a deeper understanding of the forces that control our geography, politics, culture, collective consciousness, and even our cosmic lifelines.

This experience is relevant to all.  


Participants will come to intimately understand how changing their personal 'money meme' will change reality.
The 'where' is everywhere, again since money is so pervasive.  That Burning Man is a 'gifting society' is a dodge.  It exists within a moneyed society, and only at the considerable expenditure of vast sums of money, energy and materials.  


The 'when' is similarly pervasive.  The experience will change participants forever, and in so doing help create a paradigm shift by which humanity MAY survive the onset of ecological breakdown that scientists indicate has already begun with the 'anthropocine extinction episode' currently afoot."</p>

The Black Rock Arts Foundation (BRAF) was founded by several of the partners who founded and produce Burning Man, an annual arts festival in the Nevada desert. The Burning Man event, like no other environment in the world, has created a unique venue for art, and has rekindled one of art’s most valuable functions: connecting community members in creation, curiosity, and wonderment. At Burning Man, we observe how art brings people together, inspires participation and engenders meaningful connections between individuals. The art experienced at Burning Man invites individuals to interact with both the work itself and with their community at large.

BRAF was established to bring this modality of creating and coexisting with art to the rest of the world, with the vision that community-driven, inclusive, and interactive art is vital to a thriving culture. The foundation received its 501(c)3 status in November of 2001. Come learn more and see how  you can get involved.</p>

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence Please join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our seventh year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!</p>

In the tradition of Terrence McKenna, we will get together and share our past voyages and impressions of the psychedelic experience. In the pschedelic state, to quote McKenna, "One hears and beholds a language of alien meaning that is conveying alien information that cannot be Englished. Being monkeys, when we encounter a translinguistic object, a kind of cognitive dissonance is set up in our hindbrain. We try to pour language over it and it sheds it like water off a duck's back." We will push the envelope of language to see if we can go ahead and English some of that alien information after all. Perhaps art, music or dance will play a part in expressing these otherwise-inexpressible concepts. All are welcome, whether experienced with the psychedelic state or not. Please note: this is a discussion group only; illegal substances and activities are not welcome in our camp. Please respect our need to keep our camp safe and 100% legal. Thank you.</p>

What if there was a way to mitigate the unforeseen moments that occur? Perhaps your understandings could be bolstered with a Relationship Agreement? In this workshop we'll share with you what lessons we've learned in drafting, revising, and adhering to our relationship agreement over the years. We'll also engage you in how some of these ideas might be applicable for you and your partner(s). Nobody said communication and intention in relationships was easy; we're looking to help add some texture and solidity to your foundation.</p>

Have you been wondering what is Rootism? Have you been wondering what is Rootist & PHY yoga? Well then, wonder no more:The Rootist understands that the path of oneness forks many roads. There are infinite possibilities from which we may choose along the way. It’s the journey.We will learn from our experiences as we evolve as humans, and we may hopefully learn to peel away the layers of illusion fostered by maturity and our life experiences. Through study and inquiry we may also find common threads from the ancient teachings linked to modern expressions of spirituality.We may even sense unity at some point.What is beautiful about life is that there are multiple unique levels of exploration within each of us. Each layer can reveal a different angle or new areas of focus for growth evolving us to become prismatic.Our potential is driven from the main spirit channel, the heart – the keeper of our spark. Our breathing, the spiritus from which the word spirit evolved, is feeding the spark.Self-Awareness happens when we identify and tap into the roots of our beliefs with evaluation and reflection.Rootism is the belief that the truth is all around us always yet often hidden like a gem in the rough waiting for us to discover it with great enthusiasm.</p>

        <p class="description">Also known as yogic sleep or sleep with awareness, Yoga Nidra is an ancient tantric practice that is intended to induce full-body relaxation and a deep meditative state of consciousness. 
Traditionally done in a lying down position Yoga Nidra is a systematic method of complete relaxation, holistically addressing our physiological, neurological, and subconscious needs.
Guided imagery and body scan techniques are used to take the practitioner into a deeply relaxed yet aware state. The practice will last 30 minutes. The practitioner begins by quieting the overactive conscious mind, then moves into a meditative state called pratyahara (withdrawal of the senses), gradually finding a state of “ultimate harmony,” in which the brain waves slow down and a subtle euphoria emerges.</p>

Our current form of Money, detached from any tangible asset and only backed by our trust, has seemingly taken on the role of an omnipresent Philosopher’s Stone, magically turning any quality of life into a measurable quantity of bigger or smaller heaps of cash, or rather digits on our computer screen. But not all values and qualities can be converted that easily into a pile of banknotes. After all, isn’t what we really value in life ‘priceless’?</p>

In addition to igniting the strength, suppleness and juiciness of our bodies, we'll also gather inspiration from each other to manifest our most wild, uninhibited, embodied and instinctual selves, bringing that energy into in the ways we move, breathe, dance, create, connect and play on and off the Playa.

Pregnant women of the Playa are especially encouraged to join and will be given appropriate modifications to support their growing bellies and babies.

No yoga experience required. You are encouraged to bring a mat, as well as a sarong, towel or scarf.

Meet behind the Temple (facing away from The Man).

Britt Fohrman gathers her depth of knowledge of the female reproductive system from over 12 years of work as a birth doula, as well as her expertise as a yoga teacher trained mostly in the Iyengar linage since 1993. Her HypnoBirthing childbirth education training and experience in witnessing peace and ease in birth has inspired her to apply these principles of visualization, meditation, breathing and affirmations to other aspects of women's health, particularly fertility and pelvic health. Her teaching style is warm, patient and focused on supporting each student to connect to the voice and abilities of their own body. In addition to training teachers in yoga for women, Britt has a full yoga teaching schedule that includes all kinds of therapeutic private sessions, Prenatal and Gentle Hatha weekly classes and monthly Restorative Yoga workshops.

I'll start the session off with a presentation on the guts of standard pin tumbler locks (the kind key-locks you'll find on most front doors and many padlocks) and how this translates into lock vulnerabilities and inevitably the potential for picking.  The presentation will be repeated as needed throughout the workshop.  I'll supply sets of practice locks with escalating difficulty and plenty of tools to go around.  The rest of the workshop will go to open play-time and questions.  Just bring yourself and an open mind!  I'll even bring a few challenge locks for the quick-learners, masochists, and already-experienced pickers.

It is a simple, powerful moving meditation that anyone – of any age, size, or physical ability - can practice. There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, no way to do it wrong. The only requirement is a body that is still breathing, a heart that is still beating, and mind that is still curious! Just like light, sound or ocean waves, a dancing body when moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence Please join RhythmWave as we return to the Black Rock City for our seventh year with this gorgeous dance/meditation practice that we love to share with you!</p>

Ploetry is inspirational prose cut out from planks of wood, hung from a 5-sided city-shaped tower, with color-changing backlight and custom seating.

The first entry, "I Am But Wood", is a poem written from the point of view of the Man. Next year, we want to add more Ploems, scattered as Easter Eggs around the Playa. Write a ploem, build an installation, or both  - we'll show you how. This is a workshop - all building is done off playa. But take your inspiration to write your Ploem while in Black Rock City!</p>

There has been much ado lately in the media and in our lives around words like Tranny, bitch, dyke, slut, cunt, queer, gender queer, tranimal, pussy, fag, ratchet, diva, queen, king, and the list goes on. This workshop will explore what words we use to identify, where those words come from, how words impact us, how words can both hurt us and heal us. This is designed to be a workshop for people of all backgrounds. This workshop will be a safe space for people from all perspectives on these words and all identities to explore these words and the impact they have on us. This will be a time for people to share stories of hurt and sorrow, liberation and joy and to be seen and honored in these stories. The same word that hurts one, might heal another. In this space we request open hearts and minds as we dialogue about this sensitive topic of identity, oppression, reclaiming words, creating words, and living into what these words mean. All genders, races, classes, identities, bodies are welcome and honored always.</p>

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. “Inappropriate” Laughter Yoga is also a possibility, if our clientele are okay with it. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits. Find much more info online by searching on Laughter Yoga, but come! Enjoy!</p>

Enough of this “get low” bullshit. And how come it’s always the womenthat have to get low? We already have a situation where the masses of women and the masses of people are pushed down and held down lowenough already. It’s time for us to get up and get on up.Imagine if we had a society where there was culture—yes it was lively and full of creativity and energy and yes rhythm and excitement, but at the same time, instead of degrading people,lifted us up. Imagine if it gave us a vision and a reality of what it means to make a whole different society and a whole differentkind of world. Imagine if it laid out the problems for people in making this kind of world and challenged them to take upthese problems. Imagine if art and culture too—movies, songs, television, everything—challenged people to think critically, tolook at things differently, to see things in a different light, but all pointing toward how can we make a better world.Imagine if the people who created art and culture were not just a handful of people but all of the masses of people, withall their creative energy unleashed, and the time were made for them to do that, and for them to join with people whoare more full-time workers and creators in the realm of art and culture to bring forward something new that wouldchallenge people, that would make them think in different ways, that would make them be able to see things criticallyand from a different angle, and would help them to be uplifted and help them to see their unity with each otherand with people throughout the world in putting an end to all the horrors that we’re taught are just the naturalorder of things.

We will cover basic antispin moves and learn the practice of visualizing the grid you are spinning on. Then we will explore the possibilities that grid has to offer when you apply inspins, antispins, stalls and extensions to each quadrant, in various combinations. Once you know the basic theory and building block moves, you will be able to decipher and break down complex patterns you see other spinners execute. Most importantly, you will be able to experiment yourself and discover endless new patterns to play with.

This workshop assumes at least beginning   spinning skills.  Absolute beginners are welcome, but we will not spend any time teaching the basics.</p>

We plan to cram in speeches, evaluations, and table topics into a one hour session, so being on time is a very good thing.  Prompt arrivals will have the best chances for the most fun and credit.

Our brains not only have specialized regions of spiritual perception but produce those same chemicals found in the shamanic brews and plants used for millennia. Within this framework, psychedelics are entheogens-allowing a deep, vivid experience of the inner matrix of reality. Shamanic ceremonies are designed to open these doorways. drumming rattling, mushrooms, ayahuasca, San Pedro facilitate. Patricia Savant PhD</p>

        <p class="description">The Palenque Norte lecture series brings together scholars, visionaries, entrepreneurs and activists to discuss psychedelic topics.

The Palenque Norte journey began with the legendary Entheobotany Conferences held at the Chan Kah hotel near the ancient Mayan ruins just outside of Palenque, Mexico. There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann & Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other psychedelic luminaries passed along many insights, discoveries, and wild tales to the fortunate Tribe members who were there. And it was at the end of the pool where Terence McKenna gave some of his last talks at the Chan Kah.

Years later, then in 2003, a few alumni from those conferences decided to have a "Palenque reunion" at the Burning Man Festival, and so they organized a lecture series to continue the Palenque tradition.</p>

        <p class="description">If you step back and think about it, no wonder they slander communism so much. If you presided over a system that has such glaring, howling contradictions and disparities in terms of how people lived, a system which denied a decent life to the majority of humanity, and weighed them down with tremendous oppression and superstition and ignorance, while a relative handful in a few countries lived a life of unbelievable luxury—but, more than just luxury, they continued to accumulate capital while they fought with each other over who would beat out the other through this exploitation and accumulation of capital—if you stood back and looked at that... Imagine if you said to somebody: go to a drawing board and draw up the way you think the world should be. And imagine if somebody went to the drawing board and painted a picture of the way the world is now, and they said: this is the way the world should be. I mean, there would be tremendous howls coming from all quarters of humanity, saying: What the fuck— that's the way you think the world should be, with these tremendous disparities and people, little children, dying of cholera and malnutrition and other things that could be prevented easily, while a small number battle each other to accumulate more and more wealth from the suffering of this mass of humanity—that's what you think?!

...And it's not hard to see why the ruling class of capitalist-imperialists would employ a lot of people to propagate that idea everywhere they could. If you presided over such a criminally insane system, you would undoubtedly do the same.</p>

If you presided over a system that has such glaring, howling contradictions and disparities in terms of how people lived, a system which denied a decent life to the majority of humanity, and weighed them down with tremendous oppression and superstition and ignorance, while a relative handful in a few countries lived a life of unbelievable luxury—but, more than just luxury, they continued to accumulate capital while they fought with each other over who would beat out the other through this exploitation and accumulation of capital—if you stood back and looked at that... Imagine if you said to somebody: go to a drawing board and draw up the way you think the world should be. And imagine if somebody went to the drawing board and painted a picture of the way the world is now, and they said: this is the way the world should be. I mean, there would be tremendous howls coming from all quarters of humanity, saying: What the fuck— that's the way you think the world should be, with these tremendous disparities and people, little children, dying of cholera and malnutrition and other things that could be prevented easily, while a small number battle each other to accumulate more and more wealth from the suffering of this mass of humanity—that's what you think?!...And it's not hard to see why the ruling class of capitalist-imperialists would employ a lot of people to propagate that idea everywhere they could. If you presided over such a criminally insane system, you would undoubtedly do the same.Bob Avakian</p>

It's impossible to live authentically when your internal relationship with your father is compromised. This ritual serves to transform those wounds into sources of strength and compassion, allowing participants to fully embrace themselves, live authentically and experience deep, committed intimate relationships with themselves and other men. Held at the Queer Temple at Comfort & Joy.</p>

We may speak or write relaying words from an entity out there. Phone Home. Who to talk to. Why. 
There may be a guest speaker from another dimension.
Channeling is the process of receiving and relaying information from an entity who uses the Channeler to speak or write.

Is it real? How is it possible? What type of information is communicated? Who are these entities who speak or write?

Trance Channeler Brian Porzak discusses his own channeling process and how it has evolved over time.  There may, also, be a guest speaker from another dimension.</p>

        <p class="description">Just like light, sound, or ocean waves, a dancing body moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements; STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways; CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated; LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness; and STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence. Please join Marcia Dancing Heart for an introduction to the 5Rhythms at RhythmWave.</p>

        <p class="description">We've all tried to meditate on our own… we get distracted, an a million things come into our mind and we end up not achieving what we set out to do. With Guided mediations we learn how to use voice and story to guide the body and mind into complete relaxation. When we're on the playa there are so many things going through our heads and we need to quiet the mind and feel grounded to start the day and eventually focus on our intentions while out in the desert.

In Individual guided meditation with Bobby Hedglin Taylor everyone will learn how to follow a guided meditation and experience relaxation on a deep subconscious level to shake off the every day cares and woes! You'll leave with the tools to create your own meditations and those used in class will be gifted to you to use back in the muggle world via youtube. :) You're also welcome to record the meditations we use in class to use again and again!

I can't promise enlightenment or nirvana, but I can promise a great, peaceful hour on the playa and take you to another world of deep relaxation!

Namaste

Bobby Hedglin Taylor

Get involved with some of your closest Playa friends and some new friends in trading your old Playa Dust in for a clean body ready to be dusted once again. This event honors your stated boundaries of where you do want to be touched or washed.

You will first participate in helping other Burning Man friends get washed by spraying them with Water, Dr. Bonners Peppermint Soap, washed with plenty of hands by your Playa neighbors, then sprayed again with water and squeeged off before you depart for more Playa fun. Bring a water donation to help the process along.

Hair washing may be available, depending on donated water resources and available PolyParadise members or other Playa friends willing to provide Hair Washing.</p>

Mind machines change your perception by stimulating balanced, abundant neurotransmitter production, expanding neural pathways, and programming desirable, ecologically sound behaviors. The use of mind melting can enhance physical healing and homeostasis, intellectual performance, and greatly improved a sense of well-being, which allows one to See beauty where others do not, and a new perception of life that is the Future for all Mankind.

        <p class="description">"What is Rootism?" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.

Rootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.

As an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.

Thank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.

The 8 Principles of Rootism:

∞Principles of Rootism™

2. Embrace a Creative Vision
3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly
4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others
5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth – Check the Ecology of the Whole
6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart
7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back
8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing

The acronym is "Remember"</p>

        <p class="description">Listening seems to be a lost art form. Talking heads on TV scream over each other, meetings are often a cacophony of entrenched opinions or even chatting with a friend can sometimes seem like a spewing of 2 people without each listening to the other. But when listening is used to your benefit, it presents the amazing opportunity to enrich your life with the stories of those around us, offering perspective, wisdom and connection. In this workshop you will learn the skill of active listening. You will learn how to engage those around you with a silence that demonstrates your deep compassion, understanding and interest for the story they are sharing with you.</p>

In this workshop you will learn how to engage conversations in the moment with compelling stories. When asked the question, 'tell me a story about…?', you will be ready to awe those around you with life tales perfect for any moment.</p>

        <p class="description">That rare moment when we find deep quiet in the middle of our dance is rich. But what about the rest of the time? When our monkey mind is fully engaged, our thoughts dance in and among the embodied experience we are having.  In this lab we will embrace our monkey mind and bring our soft focus to these thoughts. We will dip in and out of solos, duets, and group dances, taking time to reflect, journal, and discuss our mind's dance, and discover the pathway to underlying beliefs that hold these thought patterns in place. Once these are revealed, will we find commonality in our thought patterns? What will these beliefs point to regarding our lives off the dance floor?*

*Those who are interested are invited to bring these discoveries to the Group Theta Healing, also held at Camp Contact</p>

However during my training to become a psychotherapist, not only did I learn how to "name-it", but I learned how empowering it was to do so, and my relationships and life has improved as a consequence.  As a result I want to gift the playa some of the skills I have learnt by offering a series of "Naming-it"workshops, so I can make becoming a better communicating easy and fun. So please join me and come "name-it".</p>

By holding, rocking, and cradling each other, a direct path is formed to deep and visceral experiences of nurturance. 	Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. 	If you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels. People report that using these methods deepens and re-invigorates their relationship.</p>

I, the facilitator, used to find it very difficult to have those difficult conversations we have to have with romantic partners, friends work colleagues and so forth.  However during my training to become a psychotherapist, not only did I learn how to "name-it", but I learned how empowering it was to do so, and my relationships and life has improved as a consequence.  As a result I want to gift the playa some of the skills I have learnt by offering a series of "Naming-it"workshops, so I can make becoming a better communicating easy and fun. So please join me and come "name-it".</p>

"Smart & Simple"

With this year’s theme, we will present inspirational change agents and guarantee an afternoon of ideas worth sharing.
 
We believe that there is no more fertile venue in the world to explore Smart & Simple than Black Rock City — also known as Burning Man. The fundamental qualities of this city in the desert – the world’s largest intentional community – are freedom, experimentation, and participation, precisely the conditions in which new approaches to old (and emerging) problems can be conceived and realized.For most people who come each year to Burning Man, the shared dream is to take the values and aspirations of the Playa back to their homes, workplaces, and communities; to practice and promote the Ten Principles, not just on the playa once a year but all the time everywhere. Transforming the ‘real’ world is a formidable challenge and a powerful dream. 

Join us at TEDxBlackRockCity as we share the dream and encourage responsibility for making change happen.</p>

Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self. Whether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utilize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.</p>

        <p class="description">At this workshop psychotherapist Meriana Dinkova will introduce some important factors to consider when navigating altered states of consciousness. Some of those tools are especially applicable when working with Ayahuasca. She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world.</p>

At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts. I know what you're thinking: "Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed). Already a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!</p>

We will first warm up with some basic hand/arm stretching and then move into the different types of hand wrap techniques and balance where you will be taught how to control the levi wand. We will cover stalls, lasso’s and body breaks. Lastly, we will integrate everything we’ve learned into a magical wand dance where you will captivate others with your ability to magically float a levi wand! This will be a short string workshop. Wands will be provided. Welcome to all ages.</p>

The speaker series expansion in Center Camp Cafe this year was inspired by the events' choice of theme, Caravansary. Not just in topic, but in the ideal of searching to expand our perception of reality through intellectual exchange. In our research we started having some very interesting conversations regarding, what we're exploring; what kind of impact we want to make, what kinds of conversations we're inspired to have about the past and the present; and how those conversations can impact our future.</p>

Find love?
Fix a relationship?
Tell the truth?
Lose weight?
Create a new career?
Dismantle your excuses?
Be happy?
Take down your dark side?
Start dreaming again?
Stop limiting what's possible for yourself?
And LOVE your whole LIFE?

Guess what is standing in your way? YOU! And we're here to fix that. Like a chiropractor who adjusts your body, we adjust your life emotionally, mentally and spiritually, helping you see what's holding you back and giving you the tools to create the life you want.

As Michael Franti & Spearhead wrote in their song  "It's Never Too Late to start the day over."  Come to Camp IMAGINEnation between 12-4pm everyday and start your day fresh with a new perspective on who you are and what you want to make happen in your life.

Camp IMAGINEnation is a life coaching camp dedicated to the power of dreaming and radical honesty. Our Life Coaches go through an extensive 2-year or more training process on life issues and human behavior. We know our shit and we walk our talk.  

We are available daily 12-4 to help you sort out your life. A conversation with one of our coaches will change YOU forever. It's up to you whether you choose to come down and take that first step.

Camp IMAGINEnation was founded by The Handel Group. 
The Handel Group was born of an authentic and ambitious desire to change the world in a very positive way. It is a spiritual endeavor for us. We fully respect and love the people we help because at HG, we all work on ourselves on a consistent basis as well. We think that those who are willing to dig deep and look at themselves honestly are the most courageous people in the world, not to mention, people we’d want to hang with. In a word, we are looking to make personal development cool. We think it is.</p>

When the core muscles are strong and doing their job, as they are trained to do in Pilates, they work in tandem with the more superficial muscles of the trunk to support the spine and movement. Centering, Control, Flow, Breath, Precision, and Concentration: These six Pilates principles are essential ingredients in a high quality Pilates workout.

        <p class="description">Jennifer Russell, leadership coach, will give a talk: "Feminine Leadership: How Women's Soaring Influence will Change the World"  The Dalai Lama has said that "The world will be saved by the western woman." A tidal-shift is happening in the west, with repercussions for the whole world. Women are rising up, and gaining significant power, wealth and influence. What does the concept of "leadership" look like when it is finally practiced by large numbers of empowered women? What is "feminine ladership" and how does it differ from "masculine leadership"? Panel follows with open discussion.</p>

When the Aura is vibrant, we feel happy, joyful and confident. When our Auras are in need of repair, we may feel dark, burdened, like we don’t want to be around anyone, unhappy or even depressed. At its simplest, aura fluffing is a fun way to give and receive support. Re-energize your electrical force field to a positive vibration. Learn to renew your aura to an invigorated state @ ShangriLa.</p>

This is not based on how the world saw your parents or they saw themselves, but how YOU saw them. You are a reaction to your mother and father.

Our goal is to help you understand and address your parents, so that you do not repeat or relive their lives and issues. Understanding will enable you to intervene with yourself and design yourself and your life.  We will give you the tools you need to break a bad behavior/habit in 6 weeks.</p>

No, you won't be able to control them. No, you won't stop them from doing things that you did. But you can be there for them and be someone they want to talk to.

It's critical that you know yourself first, as a parent. The more you know your own shortcomings and how to overcome them, the more your kids will respect you. We teach you not only how to know yourself, but from there, how to design who you want to be.</p>

If so, this workshop is for you! We will explore our relationship to Yin and Yang through breath, movement, and balance with a challenging, yet restorative partner asana practice. Blending the wisdom of yoga, the dynamic power of acrobatics, and the healing elements of thai massage, you will leave feeling empowered, as well as nurtured. No experience necessary.

Kostume Kult recreates the glory days of NYC circa the 1970's by transporting you to the seedy throwback replica of "Times Square BRC". The Empire State Building and 25ft King Kong loom above the NYC skyline while a runway show that blows fashion week out of the dust goes on street level starring you. As a premiere daytime destination, Kostume Kult will be providing costume transformations to the under-accessorized masses of BRC. No person shall go uncostumed or unfabulous because we have a full team of costume stylists ready to dress you up and help you transform. The only thing we ask of you is a proud strut down our runway to display your new duds to booty moving music. If you prefer a DIY approach, step inside our Krafting Dome where you can gain the supplies and know-how to upgrade your bike and your look. Our professional staff knows their way around a glue gun and we're not afraid to bedazzle YOU! The playa provides the grit, we supply the glamour so hop the K Train to costume transformations, music and a non stop runway show that would make RuPaul blush. Of course the city never sleeps and our amazing DJ line up keeps us moving into the night as the city lights shine bright into the dark playa night. Also not to be missed is the Peepshow FreaKKshow, BRC's only 24 hour participatory peep show where you can be the star or simply sneak a peek at some Big Apples! Down our alleys you will find costumes, crafting, sparkle pony vagrants, playa hustlers, burner working gals and street wise tramps. You won't want to miss it so jump the turnstile to the KKrossroads Of The World. After all if you can make it here you can make it anywhere!</p>

        <p class="description">Join us for a guided creative visualization meditation. We will help you picture the perfect day 10 yrs in your future. The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality.

You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it.  The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. 

How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory "hooks" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel "right". 

We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process.  After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group.

We look forward to sharing your future day together.

Here you can meditate, pray and sit in contemplation. In this workshop you will create your own traveling altar, discuss the benefits of using one and get ideas on what to fill it with. The altar box and art supplies for decorating will be provided. Some altar item will be available too. You will practice using your new traveling altar through a guided chakra balancing meditation and a love activating visualization.

In this workshop, you will learn how to use the moves and practice principles of Hoop Dance to bring your life into alignment at each chakra level so you feel more balanced and happier.

A warm and soothing energy flows from the hands into the participant, promoting relaxation and releasing tension.  The participant  will be asked to where headphones playing ambient tones and soundscapes for the duration of session to also experience the healing of sound combined with Reiki.  Sessions can be given in 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on the participants needs.  Our Reiki healer will sit down with each participant for a short conversation before the session to allow them to connect and become absolutely comfortable with one another.  Reiki is joint practice between healer and participant.  The more open and accepting of the universal healing energy you are, the more powerful your session will be for both yourself and the healer.  So come, relax, be yourself and enjoy the gift of Reiki at Camp 88.  Love&Light always all ways.</p>

They have observed that all of life was circular movement which could be seen everywhere throughout nature. Man looked out on the physical world through their eyes, which is circular. The Earth is round, and so is the Sun, Moon and planets. The rising and setting of the Sun follows a circular motion. The seasons form a circular movement. Birds build their nests in circles. Animals marked their territories in circles. In the old days, tribes lived in circular homes called tepees and their communities were arranged with the tepees in a circle. Indeed, to the Natives, the whole of life appeared to be circular.</p>

I've had lots of lucid dreams since discovering this interesting phenomena 22 years ago.  One of the most interesting things you can do is use lucid dreaming to have a dialogue with your own unconscious self.

        <p class="description">Given the Mystery of the physical world explored through science, we need a corresponding spirituality that incorporates the profound insights of science, while including the Mystery of subjectivity found in spirituality and religion.
-	I propose that Cosmic Personification as a transformational identity shift that includes in Mystery, objective and subjective, and initiates and sustains conscious evolution in our lives. This shift brings the capacity for continuing our personal and social transformation.
-	I propose living fully human as the cosmos personifying as a viable spiritual meta-orientation. This would mean we intellectually, emotionally, perceptually recognize ourselves as the totality and as unique expressions of Universe. We are not separate from the Universe or each other, rather we are the Whole uniquely manifesting as these dynamic human forms. From this recognition, we shift our behavior individually and collectively to align with this deep insight into our identity. The workshop will introduce this framework and guide participants to practice, awaken, and sustain their unique cosmic embodiment for the sake of the Whole.</p>

If you follow the instructions and do your best for 70 minutes including a 10 minute healing corpse pose you will feel the clear light of your consciousness shining through . Most of the class the Eyes are shut to cultivate and connect to inner awareness while moving the body in rhythm with the Breath. Repetitive Sounds allow the the tongue to "slap" the Upper Palate Releasing Pineal Gland Happy Hormones !  The balancing effects often last 24 hours enjoying the Fully Connected All in Place Feeling .... Kundalini Yoga replaces Attitude with Altitude . We say " The Breath is King of the Mind, the Mind Rules the Emotions so captain the Breath you'll Navigate the Emotions... & a Man without Rhythm is like a Land without Water.

An experience of our divine infinite nature leaves a powerful and lasting impression on one’s self. Breath, as one of the most primitive tools for self exploration and consciousness, can be a direct pathway to this experience. Using a combination of Andean Shammanic and Tibetan techniques, we take a solid step towards the exploration and experience of inner space, and our true energetic-absolute nature.

In this workshop I offer useful information and techniques to transform our views about the purpose of relationship and its potential for harmony and growth. Learn, practice and be inspired by some of these techniques and step into your role of creating a more harmonious planet, community and intimate relationship. 
  Inspirational as well as interactive, this workshop will introduce 9 areas of knowledge that are essential to the process of navigating into rich, satisfying and authentic relationships. I will guide participants in brief energy exercises, practices in presence, clear communication and exploring courageous authenticity as well as as give background of why each area is important and how they all weave together in a beautiful tapestry of deep love. 
Included and emphasized is a lively and engaging question and answer period.  Participants will walk away with: 
1. Tools and techniques that will enliven and improve their relationships.
 2. Inspiration on how to create healthy, fulfilling relationships. 
3. A feeling of excitement about the deeper possibilities inherent in relationships.</p>

[freespace]   The experiment started in June of 2013 and has quickly spread to cities around the world. A [freespace] is a gathering place for people to come together, to create, teach, learn, and share the things which they are truly passionate about, and strengthen connections between individuals and communities through art, events, and long term projects. Anything goes as long as it is both free and inclusive like an urban version of the “permission engine” on the playa. Currently there are 8 open [freespaces] in 6 cities on 4 continents. There are communities developing in 26 locations and 18 different countries around the world. [freespace] co-founders and organizers from around the world will host an information session, discussing the [freespace] model and facilitating Q&A. Help bring the playa ethos back to your community.</p>

For over 2,400 years, the Golden Mean has fascinated mathematicians, biologists, artists, musicians, architects, psychologists and mystics alike. This “transcendental number,” 1.618… and the sacred geometry derived from it are the blueprint for all organic matter and growth on this planet. Artists such as Phidias and Da Vinci incorporated this sacred geometry into their works, believing it to create an aesthetically pleasing balance. Come to the Mycodelic Forest and learn a little more about sacred geometry and different ways to add it into your art while painting some works of your own. We’ve got acrylic paint, brushes and several sheets of heavy artist’s paper for you. (You might want to bring a hard, flat surface to work on, if you have one).</p>

        <p class="description">Part of the magic of Burning Man is the altogether unexpected nature of what will happen. For one week, we step outside of our usual selves, finding God in a phone booth, discovering your true authentic self in the eyes of clown on whip-its, or stumbling upon the Barbie Death Camp and Wine Bistro.

But, all this novelty can be a strain on your relationship. Once you combine it with the heat, dehydration, strange substances, strange food and even stranger campmates, your previously lovely and wonderful partner may seem to have turned into some sort of dusty alien. A dusty alien you can barely stand.

Fortunately, you can avoid a visit to the Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet with a bit of preparation and foresight. In this workshop, led by open relationship coach and multiple-Burn veteran Marcia Baczynski, you’ll find out everything you need for your relationship to not only survive, but thrive, at Burning Man. We’ll cover:

Your #1 secret weapon for avoiding fights on the playa (especially those really, really stupid ones)
- The real reason the Burn makes or breaks relationships
- What to do when you have different ideas of what “fun at Burning Man” means
- A quick and easy way to get the most out of your time together -- and apart
- Simple and practical steps you can take now to make your Burn together the best one ever

Plus, you’ll walk out with your own personalized guide for staying connected, getting what you both need and having a blast during your time in the dust.

Whether you’re a virgin burner or going home yet again, join us for a hilarious and practical workshop that will help you make sure you get to enjoy your camp, your costumes and your favorite co-conspirators.

Because “going to the Burn” shouldn’t mean “sitting in a hot tent processing.”</p>

In this workshop we will explore various postures, practices, movements and meditations that aim at awakening and influencing the subtle channels of energy in the body. What are the subtle channels in the body? What is the function and purpose of working with the subtle energy? 

Learning to pay attention more closely to the subtle energy flow in our bodies during our yoga practices can begin to open our awareness in ways we couldn't, when we just focused on the gross body. We will work on developing an awareness of subtle energy and then explore various theoretical models we can apply in our practice to positively transform our body, mind and deepen our yoga journey.</p>

"Popping is a street dance and one of the original funk styles that came from California during the 1960s-1970s. It is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in the dancer's body, referred to as a "pop or a hit". This is done continuously to the rhythm of a song in combination with various movements and poses." - via Wikipedia :)

Styles to be shared: Robot, Waving and Tutting

        <p class="description">Our worlds are shifting so drastically! How are we healthily holding cascading change? And how are we skillfully sharing our stories among diverse communities and across multiple views? Our worldviews often include a diversity of understandings the dominant culture considers crazy. What's crazy to us? How have we let in increasing amounts of the invisible? How can we keep breaking open over and over and not break? How do we balance revelations and responsibility, trust and urgency, crises and courage? And what skillful language and methods have we found to share these sacred, genuine, crucial, crazy things - creating allies rather than alienating, growing solidarity across the shifts? Joshua Halpern, MA is a transformation ecologist, an artist-activist-educator, and an edge jester. Josh will co-creatively guide us through a body/place based, love/justice minded, skill/story sharing, serious/fun forum for exploring these questions together. Josh has facilitated workshops for transforming homescapes nearly a half decade, has worked in local food justice for about a decade, and has been sharing the earth through art for three wonderful decades, at homes, farms, and sacred sites all over the world. He holds an MA in Integral Ecology from CIIS and a BFA in Film from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. His work can be found at placeplaying.com and he can be reached at outsidejosh@gmail.com.

        <p class="description">Psychedelics have been an integral part of the counterculture since they burst onto the scene during the revolutionary 1960s. Half a century later, human civilization still finds itself poised on the edge of social and ecological annihilation. The psychedelic experience, like much of the exotic infusions that shaped the consciousness of the 60s, has been all too easily appropriated by consumer capitalism, transformed into just another gimmick to satisfy our addiction to instant gratification. This talk will explore an alternative, alchemical interpretation of such experiences that serves to undermine the sort of ecologically and politically alienated mode of consciousness that continues to perpetuate capitalist social relations. Psychedelics are an invitation to re-imagine what it means to be human beings.</p>

        <p class="description">For the past several hundred years, Western society as a whole has been primarily influenced by the dogma that matter is as that is actually "real," and that the best way to understand reality is to approach it like a machine, seeing how its parts function. This approach, while making possible the unprecedented technological advances that began during the industrial revolution, have likewise led us to an unprecedented state of emergency - primarily seen in the ecological crisis. To remedy the alienation and disenchantment that this still dominant paradigm has propagated, we must recover those dimensions of the cosmos and of our own being that can't be found or explained in material terms. Opening our "archetypal eyes," as depth psychologist James Hillman put it, can help us to once again move in rhythm with the threads of meaning that weave through our lives and the cosmos as a whole.</p>

Most of us grew up with monogamy as the default model for what loving intimacy and partnership look like. Many assume that open relationships must always sacrifice deep love and intimacy, in favor of a more shallow connection with multiple people. 

I believe that deep love and intimacy remains, for many us, a core human need, regardless of what form of relationship we choose. We will explore what love and intimacy mean in the context of open relationships, and how we can create it for ourselves and those we love.</p>

        <p class="description">We are at a critical time in human evolution where these aspects of ourselves can no longer be separated. They are the cornerstones of our existence, the elemental factors that have come to determine our life’s quality. These aspects of ourselves continue to speak louder and louder and we are NOW unable to turn a false eye.

We want deeper sex and intimacy!

We have a deep burning desires for passion and creativity, eroticism and the unknown!

We want to give and receive love more powerfully, more receptively!!

We want to fully heal any wounds or past traumas around receiving love. 

We want to feel healthy, alive, and vibrant!

And yet, we so often leave our bodies in search for something more.

As pain continues to rise at an exponential rate in our working class society we are uncertain how to use one of our most powerful energy forces in our body, our sex, our dan tien, our bodies inner wisdom and guidance to heal us. We remain disconnected from these forces!

We desire to capture those moments of extacy, those moments where the divine enraptures us and our central light explodes and penetrates through us, releasing the forces of the mind and the controlling locks held in the muscles of our bodies.

This workshop will incorporate Feldenkrais techniques focused on opening up our 2nd and 4th chakras and reconnecting to our bodies, as well as group and partner interaction and discussions.</p>

Susan will give you a hell of a workout disguised cleverly as a romp on the playground. Acroyoga is about trusting other people enough to climb and be climbed on. Come one, come all, all levels welcome. Laughter is mandatory, sparkly pants are not mandatory however are highly recommended. If you’ve never met Susan don’t worry she’ll make you laugh, then she’ll make you do pushups. Let’s be strong, let’s be brave, let’s do some acrobatic, contact yoga already.</p>

Are you clear on what these terms really mean?  Susan Cain has written a fantastic book called Quiet:The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking.  Her Ted Talk has been viewed over 9,000,000 times!  Susan maintains that our society is set up to favor and promote extroverts. Yet it’s estimated that over a third of us are introverts.  Introverts sometimes feel devalued and not aware of the unique gifts they have to share with all of us. Through a combination of lecture, group discussion, and experiential activity, you will learn how introversion and extroversion are defined.  You will learn how being an introvert can impact on your family and work life.  You will learn how to become more sensitive to the needs of both introverts and extroverts. You will learn how to find out more about introverts and extroverts.</p>

This year there are two towers, "I Am But Wood", a poem written from the point of view of the Man, and "Voice of the Temple", written from the point of view of the Temple. Next year, we want to add more Ploems, scattered as Easter Eggs around the Playa. Forms available to write and submit your own ploem 24 hours a day, and we'll post it on the Ploetry website.
Write a ploem, build an installation, or both - we'll show you how. This is a workshop - all building is done off-season, off-playa. But take your inspiration to write your Ploem while in Black Rock City! *** Please note that this event takes place at the tower in the Cafe, not the tower on the open playa. *** MWF 11-noon, TT 5pm-6m, in the large Ploetry installation in Center Camp Cafe.</p>

        <p class="description">"What is Rootism?" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.

Rootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.

As an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.

Thank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.

The 8 Principles of Rootism:

∞Principles of Rootism™

1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself
2. Embrace a Creative Vision
3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly
4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others
5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth – Check the Ecology of the Whole
6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart
7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back
8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing

The acronym is "Remember"</p>

        <p class="description">Have you ever noticed that BM is not really a safe space for everyone? Have you ever felt like you are being treated like a freak because of your gender identity? Are you over people asking why your body looks the way it does? Are you interested in creating real safe spaces for people whether they fit in the binary or not? Are you troubled by cultural appropriation on playa and the way some folks are treated as other or freaks in a way that doesn't feel good? Then this workshop is for you. This workshop is also for you if you want to delve into the intersections of race, gender, class and how these identities affect our experience at BM and beyond. Many of us come to playa to be free and our full liberated selves yet when we pass through the gate we have not dropped our baggage of racism, transphobia, sexism, abelism, and classism at the gate.  So let's be real and talk about how these isms affect our time on playa and off and what we want to do to create the world we want to live in. This workshop will be interactive, engaging, fun, and educational. Let's define what we want the word freakshow to me and let's reclaim ourselves and whole people who all deserve respect.</p>

Vinyasa movements are smoothly flowing and almost dance-like, with synchronized breath and movements. Vinyasa has both mental and physical benefits. Physically, sweat expels toxins and re-energizes your body and can be an easy to challenging physical workout, mostly depending on you and where you take your practice. Mentally, the synchronized breathing relaxes your mind and helps to release any blockage of energy flow throughout your body.</p>

        <p class="description">Just like light, sound, or ocean waves, a dancing body moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. The 5Rhythms are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements; STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways; CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated; LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness; and STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence. Please join Marcia Dancing Heart for an introduction to the 5Rhythms at RhythmWave.</p>

        <p class="description">“Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality.” ~ Lewis Carroll (1871)  “Through the Looking Glass, and What Alice Found There” 

To peer “Through the Looking Glass” is to seek alternative perspectives, to imaginatively approach a traditional problem or line of reasoning in order to illuminate impossible solutions. This often requires a willful transformation of ourselves — a creative shape-shifting — so that we see the world with new eyes, new senses, a new consciousness. It is only in this way that a new world reveals itself — as strange, yes, but perhaps also closer to world in which we dream.

In 2015, TEDx BlackRockCity will be an opportunity to open and reflect ourselves in new ways, to a new world, in which we are all transformed by ideas that matter.</p>

Devi Flow is a power class that strengthens the core, uplifts the spirit, calms and focuses the restless mind.  Devi Flow is an evolution of intentional movement and yoga blended soulfully to ignite the warrior spirit. Using simple mudras, heart opening dynamic movement and a traditional vinyasa flow, Devi Flow awakens the inner warrior/goddess within all Yogi’s - while receiving therapeutic benefits from the practice. Together we will explore as a collective and express as individuals, creating harmony with breath, beauty with movement; all to the sacred heartbeat within unique original music and the sounds of nature.</p>

        <p class="description">Money Shadows: Creating Abundance by Dancing with The Unconscious.
 
The Playa is a magical place where the gifting economy reigns. Yet, some of us spend big bucks preparing and getting to Black Rock City. So, even here money talks even if we pretend not to listen.
 
Still some of us struggle off the Playa with not  having enough,  wrestle with “it is never enough” or believe financial issues are too taboo to explore out loud, 
 
Perhaps for the first time, we will really listen to the voices we hear in our heads or the ones we don’t even know exist which block us from creating abundance and banishing scarcity.
 
So, in a safe and supportive environment come sing with your shadows, dance with the almighty dollar  and wake up to where you are financially   so you can return to your life away from Burning Man ready to make money your ally and not your enemy.</p>

        <p class="description">Biodanza has been baring hearts since the 60's. Developed in S. America it is now a world wide phenomenon bringing joy, pleasure, balance, health and healing through music, dance and sincere interaction. Contact and caress are tools of our trade. We deal in deep human intimacy, through touch, eye contact, movement and body language. Not verbal communication. We feel each other, letting the mind and its ways take a back seat for a change. We enhance our senses, our instincts and our state of consciousness. We perceive and experience ourselves and others differently when we do this. More authentically. More naked. 
The first hour is for interactive activation and expression, maybe getting a little wild together. The second half is for slowing down, relaxing, melting and harmoniously merging with one another, exercising the polarities of enhanced sense of self to oceanic experience.</p>

You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  

How do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  

These nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   

In this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. 

-Boost your sexual self-confidence
-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.
-Understand when and how to bring up "the conversation" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!
-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.
-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!</p>

This Contemplative Dance workshop offers you an introduction to a variety of movement meditation techniques. We'll sense and feel the way that energy moves through the body with Qi Gong practice. We'll explore somatic training and the Body/Mind practices of Developmental Movement and Experiential Anatomy. We'll investigate our relationship to form, space, and each other through Viewpoints Space Awareness and Mudra Space Awareness. 

This class is a laboratory where we'll be working with the energy that animates our bodies. We'll be exploring how energy moves when the body moves and how mind can direct energy. We'll learn to harness the power of the breath and focus of the mind to attain higher performance outcomes.

The work is toward attaining a greater depth of expression of personal energy, achieving grace and ease in a variety of movement patterns, developing an equanimity of all body parts as initiators and supporters of movement in space, and gaining the ability to dance ecstatically with great amounts of energy without loss of awareness of where you are and what is around you. 

Everyone is welcome from dancers seeking to bring contemplation into their dance - to those wishing to bridge their sitting practice to their walking meditation practice to the rest of their active lives - to people who have never danced or meditated before.</p>

Words are dangerous, but assumptions... WAY MORE DANGEROUS! and, MORE FUN!! So we will be exploring where assumptions come from and creating different pathways that have a much better chance for accuracy, and.... wait for it.... INITMACY! (yes that pot of gold we are looking for at the end of those playa rainbows!) In this space of curiosity, experimentation and practice, YOU WILL LEARN the emerging art of SUBTLE COMMUNICATION. You will be able to describe your month in Bali in seven (7) words or less in a way that creates more understanding, more curiosity and, yes, more intimate connection (every time) than your 90 minute slide show and endless stories. Really... 
Answer the tiresome question "How are you?" in three (3) words that will say more, build immediate trust and help you to purge more friends on facebook than ever before! We all have the ability to 'know' more without using the left side of our brain. We just aren't so practiced. So, with a bit of science, a measure of technique, the willingness to try a 'different way' and a whole workshop of practice! we will be ready to immediately upgrade any relationship, including the one with the hottie you will meet tonight outside the Pleasure Dome! Ready!?</p>

It is not about appearances, our neighbors, the next posture. Each session would include an intention of focus that I would explain before beginning. What is more than being present?

        <p class="description">Relating from Our True Nature

This workshop is designed to be simultaneously deep and playful. We begin with a deep dive into our truth—our true nature—which is simply a letting go and a knowing of who we always already are, beyond our ideas about ourselves and others: a simple direct undeniable knowing of our clear deep heart-mind-being. 
We will ground ourselves in this present moment and connect with our higher self and cultivate our intentions, desires, and wishes for the night.
Using movement, stillness, and humor we bring awareness and acceptance to ourselves and our conditioning.
Through simple spontaneous body movements you embody and express your truth(s) and your true being. 
Finally we move into connecting and relating with each other while staying connected with our self. This process will be facilitated with some simple relating exercises and is a chance to see through our ego and conditioned habitual ways of relating and being. We invite a sense of humor to simply seeing ourselves and the conscious and unconscious games we play. 
Bringing awareness to our patterns opens the possibility of playing with them and responding from our clear deep heart mind space, rather than reacting. Respond from awareness rather than react from habits. We live from our true nature rather than our conditioning. We dance.</p>

By holding, rocking, and cradling each other, a direct path is formed to deep and visceral experiences of nurturance. Some of the movements we do induce mutual trance states by using repetitive circular motion. A hug that evolves into a spiral that is so safe and supported that we enter graceful states of consciousness. If you are looking for ways to enhance your relationship with your partner, this may be useful. Relating in non-verbal, non-linear fashion can have an effect of breaking through barriers of relating on new and different levels. People report that using these methods deepens and re-invigorates their relationship.</p>

        <p class="description">Imagine, you’ve just met someone you’re highly attracted to. You’re having a wonderful conversation and you feel the excitement building in your chest.  You’re at the point where you know you want to take it to the next level. It’s the moment of no return. This moment of tension is both one of the hottest moments of attraction and potentially one of the most awkward.  

How do you know if the other person is at the same desire level? How do you assess their openness to touch, to a kiss, or more? A kiss or initial touch is relatively low stakes, but what happens when things heat up? What happens when you’ve just overstepped a line and can feel their withdrawal?  

These nuanced moments of initial sexual attraction can be the hottest of our lives. But we’re never really taught how to navigate highly sexually charged moments with someone completely new.  What does it mean to fully take responsibility for these moments so that when we’re done everyone involved feels totally awesome?   

In this workshop you will get a much deeper understanding of the nuances of initiating and negotiating hot and sexy connections. 

-Boost your sexual self-confidence
-Know how to feel your “fuck yes!” and your “Oh no!” and everything in between.
-Understand when and how to bring up "the conversation" so you don’t deflate all the sexual turn-on!
-Gain clear sexy communication skills to keep it hot while still conveying important information.
-And learn the number 1 reason why these skills will make you the sexiest person on earth!</p>

Includes 2-hour physical practice of Qigong & Yoga that will prepare you for the burn.

There will be an explanation of Traditional Indian Medicine (Yoga/Ayurveda) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (Qi Gong/Taoism), two ancient healing systems over 2000 years old. There will be an exploration on the difference between the Indian Hinduism (Polytheistic) & Chinese Taoism (Monotheistic) theories and how we can integrate these two philosophies into our daily spiritual practice to empower ourselves.

The discussion will then be followed by a 2 hour Yoga & Qi Gong class which will blend together the elements of ancient India (Yoga) and China (Qi Gong) to provide a dynamic moving meditation focused on providing a balance of both Yang (active) and Yin (passive) elements, that will conclude with a healing Yoga Nidra (conscious deep sleep) meditation - leaving you empowered, focused, and energized - ready for the burn and the new year.

When we gather with intention, we gather and increase in said powers. This will be such a gathering...

...and in such times and at such gatherings true magic, transformation, renewal and clarity through spaciousness are even more possible, even more accessible, for that tribal heart intention is an almost irresistible force for ourselves individually and collectively. 

This heart centered gathering is a simple but profound Puja (Devotional) ceremony of seeing and being seen first in silence, then with witnessing, listening and sharing, so that we may open to the possibility of falling in love with ourselves either directly or through the eyes of another. 

I invite you to be vulnerable. To see and be seen in this moment. To open to the beautiful reflections in each other. 

Come to this gathering because you are READY to step up into your full expression. Ready to be the Strong Man and a Powerful Woman who has the right to be met, and the right to love and be loved.</p>

        <p class="description">"Where are the positive archetypes of feminine power? Kali, who cuts off your head? Hera, who is the god form of holly homemaker: basically “Zeus’ wife” with a goddess-sized jealous streak? Wonder Woman, who battles evil but has no family and no love in her life? It’s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who’s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled.

Learn how to harness the dual feminine forms and dual masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone.  For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see."</p>

        <p class="description">This workshop will explore how open relationships can be way to transform the opposition between Freedom and Love into the mutual support of Love and Truth. 

Many people in relationships struggle to reconcile their Love for each other and desire for deep partnership with their desire for the Freedom to connect intimately with others. The default model for relationship in our society, monogamy, makes explicit the underlying belief that Freedom and Love exist in opposition with each other.

But what if our desire for Freedom in relationship is covering a deeper desire, namely that we want to know, and be assured, that we can speak and honor our deepest Truths, and Desires, even, and especially, while in we are in Loving committed partnerships. So what if, instead of talking about Freedom, we talked how to create a relationship where it's safe to speak our Truths, including all of our desires (even for others), and know that we will still be Loved?

Join us for a conversation about how open relationships can be created from a place deep Love and commitment to Truth.</p>

I have 18 years coaching authentic self-expression, including 4 TEDx talks. 22 years studying people / human interaction via songwriting (and expressing my findings artfully). 28 years as a performer in various capacities, especially singing. In my career I've presented music and talks for over 100,000 people. Also, I've spent the last full year doing a deep dive into femininity/polarity studies. I am an advocate for men being empowered (especially as women claim their power more and more), and attaining the capacity to leave legacies. This includes knowing how to navigate matters of the heart. Overall, I really LOVE showing men how to feel happy and free professionally, publicly, and personally by learning how to express themselves authentically. So much of this revolves around a man's ability to limit drama and distraction in his life.</p>

As we dance, we will awaken the elemental spirits within our physical bodies as we invite that sacred tremor which frees our hearts to love to move us so that we may release that which has held us back and shed any limiting beliefs so that we may invite new gifts and possibilities into the empty space within. 

By embodying this ritual, we attune our body to tend toward our highest good while making space to step with clarity into what is next. 

Then we will offer the healing practice of Medicine Dance to melt some of the walls to giving and receiving that love within.

From that place, we will dance in the cultivated energy of the tribe - a full wave to ground all the gifts, shake loose any layers ready to release and make even more space to be empowered to our birth right to love and be loved, starting with the Self.</p>

You will come away with an understanding of:   Early Discoveries of Mead,  Mead in Religion and Culture, & the Techniques of Making Mead: -Overall concepts that mixing water, honey and yeast starts a reaction to convert the sugars in the honey to alcohol and release carbon dioxide gas. -The equipment needed such as a 1, 3 or 5 gallon water bottles, airlocks, tubes to siphon off the mead from the ‘lees,’ (sediment at the bottom of the fermentation container), bottles, and a few other items such as cleanser to keep everything clean. -Selections of honey to make mead and how the type of honey influences the end result flavor and the same for yeast selection. -Selections of ‘adjuncts’ which influence the flavor of your mead: the addition of spices such as cloves or cinnamon (known as metheglin), or the addition of fruits such as raspberries or strawberry (melomel).  We will finish up with tasting different styles! Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!</p>

Relieve stress and pain, promote natural healing, and create spontaneous bonds of friendship through group laughter. It’s fun! The brainchild of Dr. Madan Kataria in India and practiced by millions worldwide, Laughter Yoga combines Unconditional Laughter with Yogic Breathing (Pranayama). Anyone can Laugh for No Reason, without relying on humor, jokes or comedy. Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

Religious dogma can serve to uplift and inspire or separate and control. This ritual will help you strip away the confining, controlling aspects of religion to live peacefully and harmoniously. Designed by a shaman and healer to guide those seeking freedom to safely strip away the parts and pieces of religious dogma that serves to limit self-expression and love. Led by Coop.</p>

        <p class="description">Osho Kundalini Meditation is a 1-hour active meditation consisting of 4 stages. Being fully immersed in the shaking and dancing of the first two stages helps to “melt” the rock-like being, wherever the energy flow has been repressed and blocked. Then that energy can flow, dance and be transformed into bliss and joy. The last two stages enable all this energy to flow vertically, to move upwards into silence.</p>

Bring your water or hydration liquid. We’ll provide sticks for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain health through LSA, and vowed if he was ever freed, he’d dedicate his life to spread its benefits, with the proviso that no trainer could ever charge for it. (Like "gifting," eh?) He was freed, moved to Southern California, and taught classes of students and future teachers. Today, weekly classes abound in So Cal, around the US, and the world.

When you are holding onto your creative expression, your gifts, your particular genius, or pretending not to know what it is, it's gets very uncomfortable after a while. It will start itching inside of you to be created in physical form, it's deepest desire is to be born out of the dream space. You came to Planet Earth to share this, now is your time. Calling all healers, conversation-starters, rebels, light-workers, and medicine women. This workshop is broken down into four magical sections. 

1) Connection. How relating to others is the number one function of your business or passion project. We begin the workshop with getting connected on the soul level to your fellow sisters.
2) Reclaiming Your Unique Brilliance. Refining your message and creating something in the world that is unique, contributive, and that people will pay for. 
3) Healing Your Relationship With Money. Girl, if you want to start or expand your business, you've got to look at your drama and trauma with money. What would it be like if money flowed to you with ease? What would it be like if you could actually receive it? We will dive into this exploration together.
4) Closing Ritual. Our closing ritual will include a beautiful ceremony to hold each others intentions and desires as we go create in the world. You will be let into a "light-share" experience.</p>

See our solar cooker, rocket stove cooker, solar power, evapotron, and much more. Consider the Playa’s ecosystem, and the gear and food that are right for a trip into this world.Be ready for your next vacation with Mother Nature.	Nothing seems more natural than spending time in nature, but it’s easy to forget eco-attitudes when away from concrete cities.
     We’ll discuss prepping for a trip, being alert to pack only what we need: e.g., first aid kit, weather-appropriate clothing/gear, water & food. We leave packaging at home to minimize trash on-Playa. If we can, we pre-buy local fruit, veggies, and nuts; pre-make dishes and seal them in lightweight reusable containers. Reuse these to avoid disposables. We seal our food well, store trash, compost and recycle our waste.
We’ll be happy to hear your own ideas and consider them for additions to our Playa eco-practices.</p>

This creates natural heat in the body, the fire in the belly to create positive change, which allows the body to go deeper and safer into the poses. It eliminates the risk of injuries, promotes sweating and helps to release toxins. This class uses the same routine every time. Hot Yoga is a way to experience paradise on earth.</p>

It should be thought of as more of a form of object manipulation, like juggling.
  We'll have one knife throwing wall and a number of floor boards for familiarizing yourself with the weight and balance of the knives. We'll have knives for practice but feel free to bring your own. Classes are Tuesday and Thursday 10:00 - 12:00</p>

When it comes to dancing we have so many opportunities to interact in ways that we don't always give ourselves permission to do. I2M comes out of my background as a performer, contact improviser, and capoeirista. In our time together we will look at options for moving together, playfully, respectfully and with calculated risk.</p>

Chanting, dancing and other ritualistic strategies will generate a massive collective energy. No experience necessary!  For the generally creative and outgoing. It manifests a collective spirit as we create a sacred space for transformation and rebirth. Inspiration, identity and rebirth take morphing, sculptural form. The Cocoon is a hand-crafted stretchy fabric enclosure created by Sherry Aliberti, an architect and performance artist based in New York City. Structurally, these postures represent a scale model of an architecture and materiality based on the forces of the body. The Cocoon Project is a multi-disciplinary collaborative performing the Cocoon with movers, live projected visuals and soundscape. The performed-installation conveys a primordial one-ness of many bodies within the sheer membrane. CocoonNYC performs site-specifically in galleries, music venues and alternative spaces. The Cocoon experience can be emotionally powerful for every age and/or background.</p>

        <p class="description">Hello! My playa name is Turtle.

Burning man is amazing. You'll find yourself running around, completely absorbed by the flashing lights and the chaos, and yet completely unable to experience it all. Do you ever feel like you never quite got what you wanted, that you kept missing this or that you'd promised yourself to do? I do, and I love it.

I propose we set aside a time at the Harmonic Convergence Camp to sit together in silence, and in an intentional abandonment of pursuit. I did it once last year. I practically kidnapped a couple people who were spontaneous enough and kind enough to play along with the silliness. It was quite fun. Immediacy, right?

I'm no zen master but I can give you a couple simple pointers if you've never meditated before. I think it will be rejuvenating, relaxing, and pleasantly weird.</p>

        <p class="description">We are all connected to the same Source of all life, but as individuals, the experience of contact with inner guidance and spiritual beings will be different for everyone. Whether we consider these forms of intelligence to be higher aspects of our own selves or independent entities, the challenge is the same: how do we access and validate this wisdom? Our spiritual guides communicate with us through intuition, and we only need to refine our ability to receive. Craig will teach his unique methods, which include powerful ways of opening up one’s awareness to the realm of divine guidance. You will learn to trust the, information you receive, to control and direct your psychic energy and to explore new ways of creative problem solving.

This workshop will give you tools to develop a "sense a place" through pattern identification to be present in mind, body, spirit and location. To understand and view the world as a series of patterns that apply anywhere is to unlock the language of the natural world. Discussion led by Jesse Hernreich</p>

Thai Massage is an ancient bodywork practice which combines acupressure, energy meridian stimulation and yoga-like stretching. This is an Ayurvedic version of Shiatsu which encourages great relaxation and rejuvenation. The recipient, fully clothed on a floor mat, continues to remain passive, while gently and fluidly, yoga-influenced stretches are applied to them. There are many positive effects including stress-reduction, increased flexibility resulting in injury prevention, muscle spasm relief and the treatment of a wide variety of orthopedic complaints. This work is also a conscious, meditational application of Metta (love and compassion) that leaves both the giver and receiver with a life-affirming feeling of peace and connection.

Maybe it was a branch of a tree with a piece of tinsel wrapped around it? Possibly you’ve been mesmerized by one of those floating jellyfish on Burn Night?

Well – if the jellyfish is your thing then you probably need to come back for the advanced class next year. But random objects hanging from sticks covered in lights and glittery things… that’s totally our thing! That, my friend, is what we call a “raving stick” and no self-respecting raver should venture out onto the playa at night without one.

Come for an interactive, playa punch-infused lesson in the art of raving stick making, featuring group discussions and plenty of one on one time with our experienced teachers. We’ll round off the afternoon with a delightful presentation on the history of the raving stick - you simply won’t believe some of the famous names you’ll hear!

Raving stick materials will be provided on the day by Celtic Chaos, but attendees are more than welcome to bring along their own personal additions. And the best part is that each person gets to leave with the raving stick that they make... but not until they partake in a collective stick-shaking rave-off inside The Castle!</p>

Craig Junjulas shares techniques for gradually releasing the compressed energy that blocks us from our higher potential. Advanced souls, star people, wisdom seekers, light workers, consciousness explorer, burners (or whatever creative people are called these days) brought down an abundance of past life talents (merit) at birth. Needing to hide these spiritual powers from society, they also brought down problems from the past lives, and chose childhood experiences, to block and hide these powers until ready to use them level-by-level.

Most people spend a good deal of energy trying to ignore the images that flood their internal screens, clutter their minds and stir up their emotions. But throughout the ages, there will always be creative people who practice opening the third eye in order to see into the depths of this world and to explore other dimensions. Craig will teach powerful ways of opening up one's awareness to higher vision to receive insight and to shine with healing light.
This workshop will offer practical techniques for developing an enhanced ability to see psychically while being supported by intuitive sensing, the inner voice, and sensory feelings for verification. You will also learn methods for seeing energy, viewing facial changes that reveal past lives, perceiving spiritual beings, and gazing into a portal to higher dimensions - all with your eyes wide open.

Just as opening the third eye center can bring about amazing positive changes in a person’s personal and spiritual life, the act of opening the heart center can bring about an increase in understanding, compassion, empathy, self healing and enlightenment. An open heart allows you to feel protected without shutting down your emotions or closing yourself off to others. By expanding your heart and filling your aura with light, you are actually more protected and more open to the higher frequencies in any environment. Metaphysical techniques and energy demonstrations for bringing the body, mind and spirit into heart centeredness will be offered.

        <p class="description">Walking the human path while being able to fly at will throughout the higher realms is part of our natural design. From gazing mindlessly out through the window in elementary school classrooms, to blissful meditations, or exploring the universe via medicine journeys as adults, we need to be free to consciously travel out-of-body. We are residents of many dimensions. To function and contribute in the everyday frequencies, we need to be grounded but not limited. If we can achieve even a brief moment of higher consciousness we have the ability to recall the experience, regenerate it via appreciation, and reenter these same spiritual realities using creative imagination. This also means that we can dial our conscious awareness back down in order to focus on the physical world and appreciate its finer aspects. 
This is the life of the “householder” who visits the Mountain Temple of higher consciousness and brings its wondrous vibrations into the local village or city as a balanced human being.

Our coaches provide daily life coaching workshops and one-on-one coaching to the people of the playa. We are offering 30 minute sessions, Monday thru Saturday 12-4pm to help you sort out your life.
Whether it's finding a job you love, fixing your relationship, losing 30 pounds or simply being ready for the next exciting chapter in life, the work you will do with your coach will provide immediate inspiration, serious results and lasting knowledge.

Our Life Coaches have been through a rigorous training process and utilize The Handel Method, which is also the foundation of the work we teach at MIT, NYU and Stanford.

Together we dig deep, play big and don’t stop until goals are fulfilled and lessons learned. We care, we love what we do and we walk our talk.</p>

        <p class="description">To put it very simply; when someone is being a Weather Reporter, it is as if they have no control over the circumstances that exist, it just is the way it is because of influences out of their control. Being an Author is looking at things as the creator and being responsible for outcomes. 

This is especially valuable in a group like this where people are counted on to produce serious results, as the conversation is about clearing away self-limiting thoughts and replacing them with positive and proactive ones. However, this isn’t a one-time cheerleading session, but rather an introduction to a simple yet revolutionary way of thinking about things that people can take with them. Each person will begin to redefine a new and powerful context from which 
to run their professional and personal life.</p>

Gabriella and Alex will help you unlock the authentic expression of your sexuality. Become present to desire, aware of sensation, and connected to your own sexual rhythm, with just 90 minutes of simple meditation, breathing, and yoga practices. 

If you are thinking about being sexual as part of your Burn, why not start by tapping in to the most authentic expression of your sexuality possible. Pleasure, connection, love, and joy, are all possible, but you will likely need to move through layer upon layer of story and conditioning to access that. Breath, meditation, and yoga are some of the keys to unlocking the vast treasure that is your sexuality, and in this morning session you will be shown the way.

This session is highly recommended for women and for couples, however, no one will be turned away.

Alex is a full-time yoga teacher in Venice, California. She is a surfer and a total love. Gabriella is a tantric teacher/sex-positive ambassador/and event organizer, who spends her time between Portland and Malibu.</p>

Don't leave the playa wishing you hadn't done something, or conversely, wishing you had, but didn't have the communication tools to ask for what you wanted. Communication is sexy, consent is sexy, and good boundaries make all the difference between having a great experience and wishing you could, turn back time. SexPositive World has developed  fun and interesting exercises that help you get in the habit of feeling into what you really want, asking for that, and gently and lovingly saying no when preferable. If you're not sure, we've got great negotiation techniques to teach you how to get to a situation that is a win-win for all concerned. These are skills that will be with you, long after the playa dust settles: you will find yourself using them, not just in areas of sex and relationship, but with your family, friends, and employers too. Class size is limited to 30 participants. Join Gabriella and the other "sexperts" and love perveyors at Play4Play and get ready to have the experiences YOU want. Class recommended for women and couples, but good for everyone!</p>

        <p class="description">Circling is an organic, in-the-moment interpersonal process that's equal parts art form, meditation, and group conversation - all designed to allow a visceral experience of connection and understanding of another person's world, celebrating who and where they are right now. It's practicing using our genuine curiosity to better understand and become a connoisseur of another person's world through present moment awareness while breaking through the assumptions and projections we have about each other. Different than sitting on a meditation cushion by yourself, Circling is a relational practice. And though it works exquisitely in intimate relationships of all kinds, it can be applied in ALL areas of life because it's so organic, non-analytical, effective, and fun.</p>

Women's psyches are bombarded with notions of what sexy is, disconnecting us from the experience of what it feels like in our own bodies. No more shall we allow for our bodies to be used as marketing schemes to fulfill viewer‚Äôs fantasies. Now is the time to reclaim the power of our sexuality, to reconnect with our feminine sensuality and to offer ourselves the gift of deep pleasure and embodiment.</p>

The fear of expressing all our feelings diminishes, freeing us to make a genuine choices about how we act. Unspoken positive and negative feelings can create blocks in our relationships with friends, colleagues and loved ones.Through experiencing the AUM, relating becomes clearer, more honest and more fun. the AUM also allows you to reclaim to joy of simply being alive.Bring a pillow or cushion</p>

        <p class="description">The Butterfly is a high-vibrant, spiritual creation. It is sensitive to its surrounding and is vibrating in the same wavelength as the particles of niverse, as well as the life on earth. It lives in symbiosis with nature, mostly in flowers, becoming one with the Beauty All Around. The Butterfly symbolizes the Universal Spiritual knowledge and deep Wisdom, and creates its life in the perfect alignment of non-attachment, in a dance of flow and Ease. It has a life filled of transformation, from the day of birth until re-birth, between stages, outer and inner form, with ease and grace moving further, without attaching to its old shape, heart wide open for the life in front of Her. This Yogic Journey is dedicated for you to connect with YOUR inner Butterfly, through a travel of transformation, through your body and senses. Bring a Mat (if you have), soft clothing, yourself, as the beautiful and whole being you are.</p>

catastrophic climate change, corporate compromise of our
food supply, and economic enslavement, all point to the
unsustainability of our current trajectory. With all of
humanity's advances, why can't we achieve peace and
prosperity for all? The underlying cause of our failure might
be gender inequity: women are our most underutilized natural
resource. Past societies which overcame war and poverty
were governed similarly to ours, with one difference-- the
existence of a fourth branch, consisting of post-menopausal
women only. Following this historical precedent, how can we
restore women's voice in government? And, can we do it in
time?</p>

Gas scooters and electric with no human power are allowed, as long as they are stock, so they can’t be mutated. Burners are making amazing mutations with bikes and trikes.

        <p class="description">Music, whether experienced as player or listener, can be one of the most powerful modes we have of knowing and expressing the self. In this workshop, we will come together as players, listeners, and human beings to lift our hearts in song. One musician will share his relationship with music as a practice of self-exploration and invite others to share what it means to them. The result will be a mix of song and dialogue -- ideally, a union of the two. No musical experience necessary, just an open mind and heart!</p>

America it is now a world wide phenomenon bringing joy, pleasure, balance, health and healing through music, dance and sincere interaction. Contact and caress are tools of our trade. We deal in deep human intimacy, through touch, eye contact, movement and body language. Not verbal communication. We feel each other, letting the mind and its ways take a back seat for a change. We enhance our senses, our instincts and our state of consciousness. We perceive and experience ourselves and others differently when we do this. More authentically. More naked. 
The first hour is for interactive activation and expression, maybe getting a little wild together. The second half is for slowing down, relaxing, melting and harmoniously merging with one another, exercising the polarities of enhanced sense of self to oceanic experience.</p>

Explaining that even compliments in this workshop must be consensual. Leading into 3-6 pods (based on numbers). Within the pods we take turns undressing each person.  This is like the Museum of Burningman Bodies. Within each pod we each have 2-3 minutes to tell our museum visitors about our body. Depending on group vibe and any time left, viewers may ask questions of the exhibit, or  request something they would like to be uplifted upon. The next person presents. This workshop will be tested this coming week at a regional burn. I‚Äôve started something without structure before at a workshop intensive of 18 people. Great experience. **90-120 min window ** will test out this weekend</p>

        <p class="description">Biodanza has been baring hearts since the 60's. Developed in S. America it is now a world wide phenomenon bringing joy, pleasure, balance, health and healing through music, dance and sincere interaction. Contact and caress are tools of our trade. We deal in deep human intimacy, through touch, eye contact, movement and body language. Not verbal communication. We feel each other, letting the mind and its ways take a back seat for a change. We enhance our senses, our instincts and our state of consciousness. We perceive and experience ourselves and others differently when we do this. More authentically. More naked. 
The first hour is for interactive activation and expression, maybe getting a little wild together. The second half is for slowing down, relaxing, melting and harmoniously merging with one another, exercising the polarities of enhanced sense of self to oceanic experience.</p>

Meditating twice a day can not only help to optimize your personal performance, it can help to up-level the state of consciousness of innovators and world leaders (read everyone) who are positioned to solve the more complex challenges the world is facing.

        <p class="description">There are more than 50 million innocent displaced people that had to flee for war, poverty, injustice or climate change. The average stay of a refugee in a camp is 17 years. Since WWII the hosting and management of a refugee community in such camps has not changed. Till the day of today refugee camps are harsh survival environments where people risk exploitation, are hopeless and rules of the strongest apply. 

After being involved in the epicenter of the refugee crisis on the Greek island of Lesvos I came to the knowledge that there is such a big difference to be made in this global issue if we would stop seeing refugees, victims of injustice. Instead we should approach them as individuals with talents, opportunities equal to our own standards and with the same needs. We should be aware that if we would invest in people that have lost everything this investment will be returned to us in gratefulness and willingness to contribute in their own succes. You get what you give...

In creating communities that thrive you should start with environments that inspire. On Lesbos, the epicenter of the refugee crisis in Europe last year, I witnessed the similarities in dynamics between hosting refugees on a refugee camp and hosting a crowd on a music festival. We believe many insights from the festival industry can be integrated to redefine a refugee camp from a Spartan fashionlike environment to an inspiring festivallike experience.

Adding to the festival game innovative solutions/companies, educational programs and integration of the refugee community in the management and self-sustainability of their camp will create an environment of harmony and dignity that will be an example in how to change a global issue into an opportunity that can serve humanity on a global scale. 

Join me in this quest to redefine the global concept of a refugee camp to a campUS.</p>

We can also send you an image via email after the event.  Have fun with your images, which are suitable for printing, social media distribution, or decorating your computer, phone or watch.

 Alchemy requires truly seeing and embracing all elements at play in order to transmute them (the situation/circumstance) into its highest form.
 Manipulate happiness into your friends, Seduce and inspire their best qualities to come out and play. Manipulate yourself out of your own implosive self sabotage and towards your best expression.
 Manipulation implies taking advantage, So lets do Just That! What if I took advantage of your company and friendship to inspire my own joy? What If I took advantage of simple understanding of social cues and behaviors to make you feel safer in This moment than the Last moment?
 Through Intelligent, Benevolent, Skillful actions we can amplify the environment within our own beings, and the external environment to our highest collective benefit."</p>

Moving into small-groups, we will each have an opportunity to exhibit ourselves and tell our ‘museum visitors’ about our bodies, giving an intimate look into our own embodied experience. *Participation requires comfort around nudity.*</p>

Pinhole Project has brought to the playa twelve very large pinhole cameras created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. Join us in our annual pilgrimage to use old school pinhole photography on the playa.

The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.</p>

        <p class="description">A ten part, ten year art project based on the Ten Principles of Burning Man.  This year, in name of "Radical Self Expression" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.
Our aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. 
We chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. 
We also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.</p>

        <p class="description">You are invited to this Heart Opening Tantra Puja. A Puja is a devotional offering. Through this sacred ceremony we can realize of the true nature of the Self and experience into the state of total oneness.
 
 This Tantra Puja is a way of honoring and adoring the divine that dwells within each of us. 
 
 What is a Heart Opening Puja? Watch here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osqSdVTIZ_4
 
 This is a "station" puja. There is an inner and outer circle. One rotates and with each rotation you have a new partner. Each partnering is an opportunity to fall in love with ourselves through the eyes of another.
 
 The stations are subtle, elegantly simple and this is their potency. The tantric arts invite us into our own heart in an ease full way. One of the most exquisite is this ceremony where we open to an embodied experience of witnessing the divine in all and thus the diving in ourselves.
 
 Open to the possibility of adoration, forgiveness, unconditional love and experiencing your true and higher self in the span of a few short hours.</p>

        <p class="description">Hi everyone, come and get PLASTERED! ;o)

We humbly invite you all to “Becoming the Master/Mistress of Stones: The Arts of Buon Fresco!”

Welcome to the Burning Man Guild Workshops! For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. 

We, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! 

Here’s the scoop:

Apprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)

Upon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!

That’s not all! 

We are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): 

We are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. 

Please join us! ;o)

Youth ages 12 and up welcome.</p>

 The big kid in school may get bullied outright, but the pretty kid is also cursed, they can never express their self consciousness, their insecurity, their fears and alone feelings, ""its not allowed""

Merely tacking organic food and  iPhone apps onto the suburban consumerism of the fifties sells both humanity and technology short.  Rather than leaping into the unknown however, or embracing an interested vision, most people rightly stock with what they know, even as it ceases to inspire, or even to make sense.  

Experimental communities can showcase the possibilities technology and abundance have made available, preparing the disaffected to make a shift from consumerism to more advanced forms of society. "</p>

We will teach you simple traditional hand working metal skills to cut, shape, and hammer aluminum into a sexy bikini bra and/or bottom. Decorate with bits of jewelry to personalize yours. Tie with leather thong for a secure fit.  
These are the same metal shaping skills that craftspersons used in Da Vinci’s time to create beautiful works of art. Wear and share yours here at Burning Man! Allow about 2 hours for completion. Come early- limited supplies. Feel free to bring any small or broken baubles, earrings, etc.  to donate or help decorate bikinis with. 

Your partner can come watch, but this is primarily  a workshop  to empower women to learn to use simple hand tools to release their inner creativity. Costumes like this cost $$$ when purchased.  Make it as sexy as you dare. Yours is free to keep, and you'll be proud to wear it! Since each piece is custom formed for you, it will fit perfectly- large or small. And yes, it is cool, light and comfortable- even on the playa.

(As an added bonus, "Sunny" our resident body painter will also be on hand to offer body decoration if anyone who wants to wear even less!)</p>

There are no steps to follow, no choreography to learn, and no way to do it wrong.

        <p class="description">Remember that lesson in art class where you made a camera out of an oatmeal box? Pinhole Project invites you to check out our cameras, do an art tour, and make art on the playa!  Each year, we shoot, develop and fix about one hundred photographs on the playa each Burning Man. he Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.</p>

We maintain a full wet black and white photographic darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs. Photographs made of paper with traditional chemicals and no digital input. The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.</p>

        <p class="description">"Most people think hypnosis is swinging watches and parlor tricks, instead it is a powerful, complementary tool that you can use to explore creative worlds and even facilitate a dramatic healing. 
In a single Hypnosis session, one can ramp up pleasure, boost confidence, and even explore a kink in a way that requires no expensive props, gear, or flashy costumes- just your imagination! You can also ignite passion, dissolve shame, manage PTSD, or dive into even more elaborate erotic exploration.  It is possible to shape shift, time travel, change your age or status, safely feel fire, and even go against the laws of physics. Are you Captain F*cking America, a pink purring sexy kitten, or galavanting in Medieval times wielding your sword while riding a Pegasus? Yes! Anything is possible here!
Through Hypnosis we can travel far out into imaginary places, safely remove emotional blockages, as well as shift negative patterns and limiting beliefs that prevent our clients from having the intimate lives that they crave.
*Learn how and why Hypnosis is so effective in exploring kink, sensation play and more
*Learn history & practical uses for Hypnosis
*Learn how the mind sabotages the best goals and desires 
*Get a small taste of what Hypnosis is like and let’s meet come face to face with your inner most juicy and alive sensual self! "</p>

        <p class="description">In this talk, I will unravel the idea that there has to be pain in Childbirth. I will talk about where pain in childbirth originated and how through our own awareness and education we can also have a birth with little to no pain. I will talk about the history of HypnoBirthing and how in its 25 year history it is now in over 40 countries astonishing and empowering woman everywhere to take back their power in motherhood. I will explain briefly the tools and the processes used from the breath work, meditation, self-hypnosis, and affirmations to achieve an easy, often pain free birth. I will also share the numerous benefits of this simple but super effective course! After all Birthing can be one of the greatest marathons of your life and you want to be prepared with some training, to feel proud of your results knowing you put in the work and did everything you could.</p>

Stories told by others give us insight into how they think and feel.  When we hear something in a story that we connect with we don’t feel so alone in our own thoughts. Truth is, we are much more likely to remember something if we hear it in a story then just the facts. Humans are social beings and enjoy others for the most part and listing to stories gives us that connection.  But what actually makes up a story? And better yet what makes up a compelling story that engages your audience?

        <p class="description">"Embodied Intimacy is relational breathing meditation done in full body embrace, cultivating connection by relating with what is here, right now. Utilizing the core tools of Tantra: Breath, Sound, Movement and Touch we are slowing down, and we are being together just as we are. As we slow down and link up breath and sound we create all these exquisite feedback loops- body to body, belly to belly, heart to heart, and we invite each other into more and more presence, trust and relaxation.

Embodied Intimacy guides everyone gently from a state of separation and isolation towards safety and oxytocin fueled connection. The result is a simple felt presence, real time intimacy and heartfelt shared truth. The story and drama of the mind subsides and a new level of being is found in its place. In-To-Me-I-See. Sound by Sound, sigh by sigh, breath by breath it all unfolds, melts and unwinds. At the speed of love we learn how to live from the wisdom of our heart instead of the worry of our minds.

        <p class="description">Hi everyone, come and get PLASTERED! ;o)

We humbly invite you all to “Becoming the Master/Mistress of Stones: The Arts of Buon Fresco!”

Welcome to the Burning Man Guild Workshops! For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. 

We, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! 

Here’s the scoop:

Apprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)

Upon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!

That’s not all! 

We are offering a unique community project/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): 

We are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt’s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: “All You Need Is Love.” The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. 

Please join us! ;o)

We are each a temple [literally "place cut off," from stem of “tem” — to cut].  Inside each temple are housed experiences that are the basis of how we comprehend ourselves.  The temple that we are is an adventure.  In that adventure we are swimming through contradictions, polarity, wonder, desires, embarrassments; our emotions, feelings, curiosities, wounds, traumas.

In the temple, what develops is the movement of the psyche. Maibel and Anthony serve as psychopomp guides through the temple with different exercises, taking participants on a trip that expands comprehension of their human complexity, our connection to each other, the need to explore the conversations that we never had. 
　
　
<< The Temple — Convertere >>

You’ll engage in play that explores the unsaid. Go to where you can’t go alone. Reveal. Listen. Question. Vent. Return to yourself through each other.  Convertere means converter, deriving from “turn around, transform, come-together, to turn, to return.”  C/O*
　
　
<< Your psychopomps >>

Maibel was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and while residing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, she developed an acting process through the use of group research and play creation experience. She’s a permanent member of the Unknown Theater Group in Buenos Aires, which for 40 years has been a proponent of the Unknown Experience art form. 

Anthony organizes naturist and intimacy-building events in NYC and South Florida.  His mentors include Christina Berkley, Guy Sengstock, John Thompson, Sean Wilkinson, Sara Ness, Amy Silverman, Jordan Myska Allen, Gina Brezini, and Nicole Daedone.

We moderate a Facebook group called The Temple exploring the unknown, the unheard, the unsaid — and union. And another called Colony where we encourage conscious, smart, and progressive social nudism and sexuality.  

　
*Clothing optional.  Nudity is not a requirement.</p>

        <p class="description">"What you look for is what you see? If you look for gratitude, you will surely find it. 
 
 Qoya is based on the idea through movement, we remember. We remember our essence is wise, wild and free. Wise, wild and free also draw reference to the movement forms that we practice. Wise- the wisdom of yoga. Wild- the creative expression in dance. Free- expanding our capacity to enjoy being in our bodies through more sensual and feminine flowing movement. In Qoya, there is no way you can do it wrong and the way you know you're doing it right is that it feels good in your body. More than feeling good, is that it feels honest."</p>

        <p class="description">Samasati means awareness or consciousness. The purpose of this meditation is to bring awareness to the denial and fear people have regarding death. The goal of this meditation is to practice the art of witnessing rather than reaching to situations and circumstances. Be aware and remember that since you are alive, you must not take your life for granted. Choose the position: 'I will always value my life.' Appreciating my life means waking up every morning and looking into the mirror, and saying to myself, 'I am so happy to be alive!' Thank you Osho, for helping me to create this meditation." I designed this meditation so that it can be done in a group or by yourself. The first six stages are an oppertunity to practice dying consciously, a rehearsal for the end of your life. The remaining four stages are a reminder to live totally and cherish each moment.</p>

        <p class="description">In order to live in a world without war we must first heal the war between the sexes. It is time for feminine power and leadership to rise and join a healthy, incorruptible masculine. Where are the positive archetypes of feminine power? Kali, who cuts off your head? Hera, who is the god form of holly homemaker: basically “Zeus’ wife” with a goddess-sized jealous streak? Wonder Woman, who battles evil but has no family and no love in her life? It’s time for us to tell a new story of femininity, with our choices, with our self-expression, and with our lives. There are too few positive examples of women who are in full command of their sexuality and its attractive powers. There are too few healthy stories of women who’s full creative expression is unbridled and uncontrolled. There are too few healthy stories of men who are powerful without creating harm and violence .  There are too few healthy stories of men who create win-win instead of win-lose.  Learn how to harness the feminine forms and masculine forms of power in each of your interactions and become a true manifestor - brining your highest vision into reality through your being, your words, and your actions.You will learn an unforgettable map of your own sources of power, some of which have been lying dormant for your entire life. Once you can locate and allow all four faces of incorruptible power to move through you, you can lead, inspire, and serve almost anyone. For Men and Women who want to bring their full spiritual presence into the material world and be the bridge between our present reality and the future vision only you can see.</p>

In turn, our work reduces the number of drug-related hospitalizations and arrests.
 
This year, millions of people will use psychedelics outside of supervised medical contexts, many of them for the first time. Difficult psychedelic experiences can be frightening, but also potentially among the most valuable experiences someone can have. What can you do to help someone having a difficult psychedelic experience? What techniques are available for helping transform a potentially traumatic situation into a positive or even therapeutic one? What role has the Zendo Project played at festivals, and what take-home messages are available for others interested in psychedelic harm reduction?</p>

We are each a temple [literally "place cut off," from stem of “tem” — to cut].  Inside each temple are housed experiences that are the basis of how we comprehend ourselves.  The temple that we are is an adventure.  In that adventure we are swimming through contradictions, polarity, wonder, desires, embarrassments; our emotions, feelings, curiosities, wounds, traumas.

In the temple, what develops is the movement of the psyche. Maibel and Anthony serve as psychopomp guides through the temple with different exercises, taking participants on a trip that expands comprehension of their human complexity, our connection to each other, the need to explore the conversations that we never had. 
　
　
<< The Temple — Nuptias >>

Can partners be more free together than apart?  A new comprehension of polyamory and exclusivity: the Hermetic Relationship.  C/O*
　
　
<< Your psychopomps >>

We—Anthony and Maibel—live the experience of returning to themselves through each other. We enjoy practices that stimulate these experiences that make us more vulnerable, more naked, more pure, more devoted.

We moderate a Facebook group called The Temple exploring the unknown, the unheard, the unsaid — and union. And another called Colony where we encourage conscious, smart, and progressive social nudism and sexuality.</p>

 Come co-create this special evening where we will be invited to find our ease in connection.
 
 Touch is a place where we as humans are often feeling a lack, but have an edge around asking for what we may desire or need. 
 
 Let us create a container where all may be witnessed in their desire. A container where guilt, shame and fear around giving and receiving touch may be stripped away. Where we simply interact with consciousness and choice and that each honoring of another further honors ourselves.
 
 We will begin with a simple ceremony of seeing and being seen, so that we may drop into presence with one another. 
 
 From there we will co-create our agreements and boundaries for the evening. Then we will engage in some guided massage, so that no one needs worry about skill or technique. We can all learn and explore together.
 
 Elemental massage is a beautiful way to welcome our bodies and explore differing kinds of activating and sensation touch.
 
 Know that you may choose to participate with a particular partner. All boundaries around partnership, touch and clothing will be honored. 
 
 This is an evening of self-exploration, opening to our natural touch-positive nature in a way which is intended to open more pathways to self-love."</p>

 You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). A morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. We can create morphic fields at will, because our intelligence is able to. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. What this workshop proposes is the creation of fields of intelligence through movement, because I believe that as human beings we are prepared to communicate with new languages. Art informs certain languages ​​that are developed over time, and perhaps now it's time to take those languages ​​as structures that allow us a different way to function in life.
 
 Morphic Field Movement becomes physical expression, borne from body languages, from the poetry of the body, from the clear expression of the bodies...</p>

        <p class="description">Do you want to experience poetry of the body while hardly moving at all? 
 Contraexpression is not passivity or the anti-expression; it’s 'contrary-expression' of any expressive stimulus, and it’s irresistible. There is no wrong way to do this.
 
 Open the door to your body to express the unimaginable. 
 
 In the experience, you will be guided through a passage in which you find your own way of moving the body. I don’t ask anyone to move their body in a rhythm, nor engage bodies, nor expect that all the people do the same action. People don’t need to follow a pattern or imitate; it’s experiential, there is no wrong way to do this. I give directions based on trust in the body, and what it can manifest. The person will discover how to adapt these directions to their understanding and needs. Maybe someone can move rapidly, maybe another can move slowly, or hardly at all — each one with their own development and course of action.
 
 This workshop focuses on the method of “The Unknown Theater” (El Teatro Desconocido) directed by Juan Carlos De Petre and developed over forty years by a group of people concentrated on exploration of subtle expression. The practice reveals knowledge; we start from the consciousness of not-knowing — ignorance is the beginning. This knowledge is experimental and creative; not intellectual, preconceived, acquired through repetition, or memory. Participants will work as a unique being, independent, and according to their own development. You can overcome intimidation and shame; discover empowerment, physical malleability, and grace.</p>

Merkabah activation is a 3000 years old breathing technique that allows to open a portal in our heart chakra. This will bring us to feel the vibrations and the energy of the universe. The intensity of the technique depends on the person, ranging from an incredible feeling of ecstasy, until space and time journeys. Being a technique that connects with the inner and higher self, it will also allows to experience breakthroughs, get answers about our lives, solve problems that we didn't even know to have. The more open to receive love and the more open minded we will be, the more we will get from this practice. The technique is as powerful as magical. Almost everybody that have experienced it, described it as mind blowing, many as life changing, some others as the most powerful moment of their life.
Prepare to experience yourself in Totality!</p>

 For instance, if we want to only say things that are so objective that a camera could pick up on them, we might say "I notice your eyes are squinting and I see you are smiling" instead of "I see that you are happy".
 
 Because we don't know if that person is happy for sure, they could be putting on a face because they are nervous and afraid!</p>

 First we enjoy a Tantric Chakra opening Dance where we will feel our place between heaven and Earth through sacred embodied expression
 
 Then in the state of connected bliss Fia will lead us in a heart song circle!
 
 Singing together gives us the space to clear out our energetic field, raise our vibrations and let go of what is no longer serving us. Through singing we can develop deep contact with ourselves, it opens the heart and silence the mind. It connects us with each other and is a way of being present in the now. 
 
 About Fia:
 Fia Forsström is a singer-/songwriter from Sweden who creates music with a wish to move something inside of you. Lyrics that reflects all of life; here is the beautiful and wild, but also the ugly and uncomfortable. She is driven by evoking thoughts and to inspire. She has a great passion for the healing power of singing and creating spaces where people can meet each other just as they are. After experiencing the enormous joy and energy of chanting circles, singing together without any focus on achievement and instead let the song come from the heart, she wants to open up and invite more people to share that magic.

For you sensitive ones who have been experiencing intense energy and transition, know that the portal is now open for amazing, exponential growth and karma clearing! Now is the PERFECT time to integrate the endings, awakenings, transformations, death and rebirth experiences related to the self and others and to welcome a more balanced exchange between the masculine and feminine as well as man and woman.

Imbalances in females sometimes shows up as feminine infections, shame, control and dis-empowerment issues, suppression of desire, and feelings of inadequacy.  In males it may present as an unfulfillment of sexuality cravings and desires or difficulty connecting fully with the opposite sex.

This class will be a combination of lecture, group shares, and interactive exercises.</p>

Quantum Sound & Sacred Scalar Energy GROUP MEDITATION
 
Uproot unproductive subconscious thought patterns, shed pounds of emotional baggage and re-ignite your connection to Source!

Stand in your strength and actualize your greatest life!
 
In this experiential journey facilitated by Sharon & Lothlorien, you will participate in a group meditation using Quantum Sound Technologies as a method of Energetic Stress Release.

As well, the VAS (Voice Analysis System) Technology analyzes the groups voice sample, and then creates custom frequencies that the group then listens to. What’s in YOUR Voice is in YOUR Life
 
The leading premise of the VAS technology is that every human voice has a unique frequency that is measurable. These tones will balance and harmonize the group energy and facilitate personal shifts on many levels.
 
Please bring yoga mat/towel and pillow and get comfortable.

Sharon is a licensed Spiritual Health Coach and grateful for the opportunity to share these amazing tools for change.</p>

Weather you're poly with children, or otherwise in an open relationship with or contemplating children, this special Poly High Tea discussion is for you. Bring the kids and lets hear from them if you like (or dare)! If all this seems overly daunting, don't worry - it is! So let's put our dusty heads and hearts together and see what we come up with. This is an open discussion facilitated by Peter & Gretchen (aka Adam & Eve) about all things poly with children. This will be their 8th Burn, and the second with their 5 year old daughter, Veronica. Don't expect us to have all the answers, instead come to both learn and teach! Juice boxes and animal crackers provided to help grease the conversation.</p>

Oscar Wilde's words have great explanatory and predictive power, but I'm curious about the limits of this model. 
Where & how does Love come in?
Could True Love honor our drives for power and sex by holding them sacred and taking them with us to the next level? Come explore these themes:
    -How does power & sexuality constrain or inspire intimacy?
    -What's the relationship between fear, control & sex
    -Influence & immortality -the ultimate power
    -Can a conscious partnership creatively co-op our need for control?
    -Could True Love offer a map through the power struggle?
    -Why we fuck? Why we fuck off?
Join us for a edgy exploration of how these important ideas intersect. Bring your taboo questions & leave all assumptions at the door.</p>

 We will begin this class with a heart opening meditation followed by a Feldenkrais lesson that will help us to open our hearts and connect more deeply with our bodies.
 
 The Feldenkrais method emphasizes the connection between the mind, body, and spirit. Though gentle, relaxing, non-impactful movement sequences along with inspirational meditation, you will leave the day standing straighter and taller and with your shoulders falling back behind your chest, hence allowing you to lead with your heart as you walk forward into the world.
 
 Think of Feldenkrais as meditation with movement! 
 
 If you are experiencing any pain, you might find it improve or resolve throughout the class. Feldenkrais helps with the realignment of our bones, muscles and joints and with the coordination of our overall movement patterns.
 
 As we radiate more love out into the world, the world can’t help but smile back. And with that, only magical shifts can follow.</p>

        <p class="description">Are human naturally monogamous or promiscuous?  Neither view makes sense given what we've learned about human sexual psychology in the last couple of decades. Most of us seem to have evolved over the last million years to be polyamorous by nature. But we are socialized into monogamist mating norms that amplify sexual jealousy, reduce compersion, stifle our sexual sovereignty, and limit the social networks that we instinctively try to build through lovers and metamours. In this talk, a leading evolutionary psychology professor (author of 'The Mating Mind', 'Spent', and 'Mate') will give a quick, fun overview of the new science behind poly. Then we'll have a Q&A.</p>

A leader in the camp Refoamation, Adam's philosophy of Phrygianism combines citizen action, psychedelics and civil defense.  In 2014 Adam legalized marijuana in Washington, DC and will talk strategy.  He'll also speak about the Liberty Cap and its role for thousands of years connecting liberation struggles since Roman times as well the to cap's connection to psychedelic spirituality in the Mithra tradition

Adam has been arrested 18 times fighting for justice in the Belly of the Beast, Washington, DC.  He is the social action director for Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps and is the foam OG who first set up the magic foam at Burning Man with Kris Bronner in 2009.  Since then he's helped lead the Dr. Bronner' camp (called Refoamation in 2016) as it has expanded its perfoaming activities.  Adam has been making creative plans for major protests since 2000.  His talk will reveal practical tips and advice for anyone activist or non-activist.  Adams lives by the creed of Ralph Nader who once said, "If you don't turn onto politics, politics will turn on you."</p>

This purpose of this workshop is to educate and enlighten those interested in knowing more about this 3% of the public that few understand. This workshop seeks to help transphobic people... Not in a judgmental way... This is meant in a good way. The very basic definition transphobia, is simply being frightened of trans-folks because of misunderstandings or lack of education on all things trans. This is often because the questions you’ve always wanted to ask, are taboo; making it difficult to learn, understand, and honor the transgender path.

Trans 101: The Nuts and Bolts.
A brief PowerPoint discussion of definitions and the basics of gender, gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation. How are transgender and cisgender people alike? How are they different?

Trans 201: A Peak Through the Veil.
After learning the basics, we’ll have a Q&A session where any and all questions will be fielded. We all know that there are questions that are deemed inappropriate to ask a transperson. For this brief moment in time, there are no taboos. We will do our best to answer your questions with honesty, transparency, and sincerity.

Trans 301: Dropping the Veil.
We will bare our souls and our bodies for visual inspection and further Q&A.

Trans 401: Shredding the Veil.
For those brave audience members, we will open ourselves to not only visual review, but hands on, or hands in, examination.</p>

        <p class="description">Leonardo knew about many of the uses of hemp ...  It's a soil remediator and one of the fastest growing, most useful biomass crops for manufacturing that you can farm.  Industrial hemp fibre crops harvest high volumes of carbon very quickly, so farming and building hemp housing is a very effective way to store carbon - each build locks up tonnes of it. The buildings are also thermally effective so you have reduced operational energy costs. The broad opportunities for value adding to fibre crops mean that wherever communities work together with farmers, they can potentially create major positive change.</p>

        <p class="description">We will warm up with Movement Meditation to arrive in our bodies and listen to the wisdom within. As we dance, we will awaken the elemental spirits within our physical bodies as we invite that sacred tremor which frees our hearts to love to move us so that we may release that which has held us back and shed any limiting beliefs so that we may invite new gifts and possibilities into the empty space within. By embodying this ritual, we attune our body to tend toward our highest good while making space to step with clarity into what is next. Then we will offer the healing practice of Medicine Dance to melt some of the walls to giving and receiving that love within. From that place, we will dance in the cultivated energy of the tribe - a full wave to ground all the gifts, shake loose any layers ready to release and make even more space to be empowered to our birth right to love and be loved, starting with the Self.</p>

        <p class="description">Medieval Germany is known for the stories collected by Brothers Grimm, the Hanse trading company, people obeying to the rules of their kings, and
Gutenbergs art of printing. All of these attributes are reflected in the G.E.R.M.A.N. guild workshop. This workshop is about rule making and printing. Following a playful structure, a personal rule of life and/or behavior is told and traded for a new rule, which is chosen or created by chance. To make this new rule a temporary or permanent part of the participants life, he or she can print this rule on pieces of old German files, badges, wristbands or even body parts.</p>

Come to a safe space of surrender and explore how to activate and discover your most powerful pleasure centers with your clothes completely on (or off if you really insist).We tend to think of our most sensitive spots as our genitals, but the truth is the entire body is a pleasure center and the skin is the conductor of this pleasure train. The crazy part is you don't even need to touch bare skin to experience an amazing sense of surrender, pleasure, and relaxation. Bring your friend or partner or get paired up with a beautiful playa temporary stranger (probably the coolest way to do this). Be prepared to experience sensual bliss that can serve as the best foreplay possible or just be a friendly touch to excite the body. with Eric Brief</p>

Joining in patterns and repetitions—one dance, one motion, one wave of energy—we come home to ourselves, each other, our home on the playa, and the essence of pure love. Leave Black Rock City with love and your family firmly embodied in your heart. Make an ending you will always remember.

        <p class="description">A deep dive into death, suffering and challenging fate through simple physical practices - opening the heart and accepting what life has to give.
In many cultures death is seen as the unknown, the point at which it is difficult to determine what happens next. Will death be the end of life? The pain experienced in the lead-up to death or the manner death is portrayed may have lasting impressions on how we determine our own death. If death is a passage and a natural step, like a leaf that falls and disintegrates into the earth, how do we best prepare to be ready, at a moments notice to fall onto earth, without a shred of remorse, guilt or unpacked potential? This workshop is about giving yourself a chance to look deeper into death with a clean slate. Determine your own method to prepare for death and live life with an openness to dying. The heart-opening exercises are done alone, and with the group using resonance tuning, energy-centering and creative visualisation. Raise your consciousness!  with Tia Kansara</p>

Open yourself to the possibility of living the paradox of being joyfully alive in this tangible realm we live in while at the same time being liberated and awakened in this body.  We as humans are microcosms of this universe, whatever exists in the outer universe also exists within. Feel the vibrations of this tangible Earth we live in knowing that everything is in motion and nothing rests. Tantra is a system so intuitive and natural to human kind that its essence can be seen within all spiritual paths from the Celtic, African, Native American, Sufi, esoteric Christian, Hindu, Sound Healing, Kabbalah, Buddhist, and Taoist wisdom traditions. It is a set of spiritual practices and ritualistic actions that through personal effort and experimentation are designed to direct universal energies of the macrocosm into the practitioner to achieve total liberation from ignorance and suffering. In this workshop we will use a myriad of psycho-physical exercises learned from different traditions for modifying and exploring consciousness. We will feel the energy of the Earth and learn to appreciate this vibratory field we exist in. with Ashleigh Rojas</p>

What would be possible, if by the end of 2016, you had your bad behaviors under new management? Wouldn’t you have a totally different experience at work? Wouldn’t you be more impressed with yourself? Wouldn’t it be worth it? Wouldn’t you be proud?

Check.

Come learn how to nix your negative traits, and get fighting for the right team, your dreams team!</p>

For example, he says, “tomorrow it’s going to rain; for the next five days it’ll be hot & muggy”.  And, you say things like, “today sucked and I’m a procrastinator”, or “I’m not a morning person”, you know, “I’m cloudy with a chance of a storm”…as if you have nothing to do with it, it’s just how you and it is…

But doesn’t weather reporting yourself into “not a morning person,” just gives you a doctor’s note from being nice until noon?

We are all sneakily weather reporters in our lives, pretending we have no say over how we are going to be or how things are going to go.  But what if it’s not so?

Uh oh is right. What if you are actually the author of your life?  

I mean, who else is?  In this workshop, you’ll begin to redefine a new and powerful context from which to run your personal and professional life, where you have a say over the weather.</p>

In this workshop, we will touch on the basic understanding of fear and it's differentiation from Worry, Anxiety, and False Fear. Then dive deep into existentialism explaining why fear has such a programmable hold on our free will, and biology, causing our impulsive actions and thoughts. Then we will explore techniques I've used to transcend my own fears, self-defeating beliefs and habits, freeing myself from years of insecurity, blame, resentment, childhood abuse, guilt from molestation, and general self-hate.

This includes finding and learning about the how the lost triangle of Pythagoras defines the slopes of the faces of cubic polyhedra. 

Within the space are four areas. The primary workshop/classroom includes seating and work tables where visitors will learn about the Lost Triangle and make a Lost Triangle template to take with them. Visitors also will have the opportunity to learn more about geometry by assembling small scale models.

There will be a dome with built in seats and a transparent skin being used for 24/7 multi-media presentations, and the Gypsy Wagon and car “SV 3 Rose” all made in plywood with integral slotted and notched connections, more whimsical creations as if from the mind of Leonardo.</p>

This is a live storytelling event where together, we explore the mythic landscape that is living in our unconscious. Through the combination of exploring the symbols, archetypes, metaphors that show up in the one of a kind story created in our time together, you are provided context and tools to explore the power and potential of your story and how to use it to access and embody the parts of you that may be lying dormant. People have requested stories that will heal, provide insight about their gifts, and help them access their personal power. 

What to expect from A Soul Story Circle: When we gather in a circle, one person is chosen to receive a story that will serve all. We then go through a process called talking back to the story, where we make sense of the symbols, metaphors, and archytpes that presented and how they apply to our every day lives.</p>

Come learn from a professional cartoonist to practice this expressive and enjoyable skill.  All skill levels welcome; you do not need to have any prior training or experience.  Learn all the basic skills like character creation, layout, composition, perspective, and comedy writing.  Brush up on advanced techniques like human and animal figure drawing, proportion, and color.  We end with an improvisational art game using the cartooning skills we've learned.  Supplies provided, or bring your own.
* Forged out of the eons of Deep Time and raw forces of Nature, a uniquely shaped and smoothed river stone awaits your unique curiosity in an ephemeral moment of creative exploration. We supply you with the stone, paint and guidance; you supply your awareness, vision, and imagination. Together on your planetary journeys, after 4.5 billion years you and the river stone meet. Silly or profound, the colors or imagery are all a part of the play on the Playa. Will your rock become a bug, a power object, a flower, or a psychedelic paisley? Experienced art teachers can help with color mixing, brush technique, and concept execution. Create a memory to keep or offer as a gift. Thurs: 3-5PM.</p>

 Qoya is based on the idea that through movement we remember. We remember our essence is wise, wild and free. Wise, wild and free also draw reference to the movement forms we practice. Wise- calling on the wisdom traditions of yoga. Wild- the creative expression in dance. Free- expanding our capacity to enjoy our bodies through more feminine and flowing movement. In Qoya there is no way you can do it wrong, and the way you know you are doing it right is that it feels good."</p>

 Rhythmic movement and deep pressure help stimulate the body's own healing processes. The receiver remains clothed; no oils are used. 
 
 One partner receives while the other gives; halfway through the workshop we switch so that each gets a turn.
 
 We focus on the essential core elements of safe and effective bodywork: Intention, Connection, Safety, and Self-care. The Thai yoga bodywork sequence used is a slow-moving, simplified yet effective sequence. Poses can be modified as needed to accommodate individual differences. No prior yoga or bodywork experience needed!"</p>

I have practiced this meditation by myself for about 2 years. I am curious to see how this will work in a group setting as this would be a new experience for me. It is an open-eye meditation technique that focuses on the breath while also taking in your surroundings. The walking meditation focuses on the sensation your feet feel while walking at a slow place in a small circle. This practice helps form a connection with the earth as a sense of grounding. With practice, this technique helps one discover who they really are, not who they feel they are supposed to be. It has done wonders for me and truly changed my life. The instructions are very brief and basic and each person's experience is unique.</p>

This approach to healing is based on the Eastern philosophy of synchronizing the body and the mind. Once we do that we can begin to truly heal from any emotional or physical issues we're dealing with. I've practiced a technique called a body scan which helps join body and mind. I'm curious to see how this would work in a group setting as this would be a new experience for me. After the body scan, I plan to start by asking everyone what they want to heal from and from there perhaps develop a common theme among the participants or just see what comes up and go with the energy in the dome.</p>

        <p class="description">Use the power of platonic (non-sexual) touch to transmute sexual energy into spiritual power – Pure Love.

"When yin and yang (or masculine and feminine) come together, it produces energy. Often, that energy is sexually directed. Combustion happens, but usually from the loins. This is part of our “animal / darwinian” nature. Nothing wrong with it per se – it is part of who we are. It is how the human race continues. 
 
 And, we are more.
 
 This powerful energy can also be directed up and through the heart. And when it is, that force of energy has the power to soften the heart and break through walls we may have built up around it (fear, resentment, grudges, and other things that keep us from feeling our own Divinity). If the heart is open and cleansed, energy can move into that space. When it does, it creates a pleasure that makes sex seem rather mundane. The energy gets transmuted into spiritual power and ecstasy – Pure Love.
 
 In this workshop, we will use the power of yin and yang, platonic (non-sexual) touch and loving friendship to soften, expand and ignite the heart with Pure Love.
 
 Using the Light of our eyes and the Energy that moves through our hands and hearts we will connect with each other, swim in Love and glorify the Divinity within our hearts."</p>

        </div>
        <p class="description">Contact Improvisation is a meditative dance technique in which participants use points of physical contact to provide the starting point for exploration through movement. This contact can actually induce the production of a pair bonding hormone, called oxytocin, in the human brain, similar to how you feel when you hug or kiss a loved one. 

Through the sensation of touch and dance, you can explore organic movement generated through and with, one-another, forming new bonds and strengthening old ones.

Accompanied by a variety of musicians, this session will begin with some simple guiding prompts to help individuals become familiar with touching as well as giving/receiving weight. As the jam progresses individuals get to explore movement by listening and responding to their partner/partners through touch. There are no right or wrong answers and you do not need prior dance training to participate. 

The central characteristic of Contact Improvisation is a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements.  Much like meditation, Contact Improvisational Dance seeks to honor the present moment by guiding the dancers to surrender what is happening now. 

“One learns to recognize and differentiate subtle impulses in our movement choices and our partner's choices. We begin to decipher the cues that we give and receive which tell us when to lead or follow, when to go up, when to go down, where to touch, how to lift, when to slow down, and when to be still. In this form one learns to stay in integrity with each choice, never forcing, never rushing. When Body, Mind, and Spirit are united in their instinctive wisdom one finds ones-self at home in every moment expressing ones true nature.”

You will be given exercises that stretch the imagination about what you can explore, say, represent and ask through dance. We will be working with the elements of the body, shape, space, and time; qualities of movement, different types and speeds of music and ways to modify phrases/sequences. Continue to learn new tricks and sequences while using the skills that you already know or are focusing on in other classes.</p>

It is not always the most appealing sound, especially for beginners, but sometimes you need to sound ugly before sounding awesome! 
The krackle is the rubbing together of the vocal chords, which gives you immense breath control, builds range, and give the sound extra resonance and brilliance. The krackle will get your voice anywhere you want it to take you. Once your voice has worked through the krackle, then it is ready to be garnished with other beauties, like breathy and flowy goodness. But for now were krackling it up!</p>

        <p class="description">Just like light, sound, or ocean waves, a dancing body moving freely passes through five distinct rhythmic patterns. These patterns continuously repeat themselves in a wave of motion. Gabrielle Roth's 5Rhythms® are: FLOWING – the fluid, continuous, grounded glide of our own movements; STACCATO – the percussive, pulsing beat that shapes us a thousand different ways; CHAOS – the rhythm of letting go, releasing into the catalytic wildness of our dance that can never be planned or repeated; LYRICAL – the rhythm of trance, where the weight of self-consciousness dissolves, where we lighten up and disappear into our own uniqueness; and STILLNESS – the quiet emptiness, where gentle movements rise and fall, start and end, in a field of silence. Please join Aaron Lifshin for an introduction to the 5Rhythms movement practice, at RhythmWave.</p>

        <p class="description">"The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a new name for a concept deeply embedded in human nature: that by choosing to do something we're going to miss out on something else that is even better.  In cognitive psychology FOMO is known as loss aversion.  Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.  Basically FOMO is the losing out on what others are currently experiencing and valuing it higher than the gain of your current experience.  An early example of FOMO comes from Tulipmania in Holland in the 1590s.  Seeing and hearing others buy into the promises of tulip profitability encouraged others to do the same. Nobody wanted to be the one missing out. 

When you lose something it hurts and often to avoid this negative emotion strange behavior may occur. This talk will give insight into why FOMO occurs and illustrate that it happens not only to Millennials anxious about what experiences their peers are having, but also to those making business and investment decisions.</p>

A song that’s written for everyone. But more importantly, we’re creating an inspiring new story as part of a full length feature documentary… a story that we’d like you to be a part of.

Project Prayer Song is about creating something bigger, collectively, than any of us ever could by ourselves. Our intention is to paint a picture of some of the challenges we face as human beings, and to unite singers, musicians and everyday people from around the globe to demonstrate through music and film, that we can create incredible beauty if we work together.</p>

        <p class="description">"A Puja is a devotional offering. In this sacred ceremony we will take off the protective masks we often wear to discover a deep connection with ourselves, our fellow humans, and to life itself. We will be guided through vulnerable, heart opening and playful exercises, rotating to explore with different partners in a safe way. Experiences may include questions, PG touch, breath, and the healing power of being truly seen and heard with unconditional love. You may find there are ways you hold yourself back out of fear, and this will give you an opportunity to open to more freedom so that you can connect to others with trust and joy, celebrating everyone including yourself as a reflection of the divine.</p>

As we heal our nervous system of the trauma and pain accumulated from the experience of learning in our human bodies, we create a space for expansion and connection. We summon you all to hear the call within you, stand in courage, and bravely face down your pain and trauma and emerge whole and fully expressed as an innocent, fearless, loving, joyous being. We recognize that it is important to be respectful of indigenous cultures and practices when using the term "Shaman". The Ceremony leaders do not consider themselves to be Shamans, yet we find it is the best way to describe the ritual being used in this healing ceremony so we feel good about using this term to describe the practice, not the leaders. Shamanism is the practice of inducing trance in order to achieve a state of non-ordinary reality in order to communicate with the source energy that flows through all of life, healing spirits, animal spirit guides, angels, and ancestors. This practice also calls upon the elemental forces for cleansing and healing of mind, body, and spirit. Pranic Journeying takes us into a place of non-ordinary reality where deep release of mental, emotional, and physical blocks may occur. In this state we are open to receive deep esoteric truths, connect with our helping spirits and ancestors, and merge with our higher self and higher consciousness. The journey is unique based on the individual although the group undergoes a unique journey together as well. Each journey can be very different as the healing intelligence of spirit knows just where to take us to safely clear the energy in alignment with our intentions. There are many ways to induce a shamanic trance: drumming, dancing, singing, ingesting plant medicine and breath work. In this course we are using a form of breath work we call “Healing Breath” which is s</p>

        <p class="description">Let's have a heart felt community conversation to reflect on our actions. To examine how to work towards right relationship with cultural traditions that aren't of our personal ancestry. 

•  Adornments and Healing Arts? Rituals & Spiritual Practices? Permaculture & Herbal Medicine? By engaging openly with sacred cultural traditions, are we unknowingly re-colonizing and harming oppressed people and cultures? (Cultural Appropriation). 

•  Do we know the true history of these traditions and peoples? Are they being oppressed? Are we benefiting? What questions can we ask ourselves? What can we do? 

 • What does it mean to decolonize ourselves and why is it important to talk about it? 

•  What hole are we seeking to fill? What is it about mainstream consumerist culture and our own histories of immigration, assimilation, and struggle that leave us seeking connection and wisdom from indigenous cultures?

Let’s reflect deeply from a place of love. Let's ask ourselves and each other these questions. Let's learn from the many resources available and talk about these complex issues that affect us all. Isn't it our shared responsibility to move towards right relationship for peace and freedom for all beings. Let's have these conversations ongoing, on and off the playa. Would love to see you!</p>

        </div>
        <p class="description">Do you want to experience poetry of the body while hardly moving at all? 
　 　 
Contraexpression is not anti-expression, passivity; it’s 'contrary-expression' of any expressive stimulus, and it’s irresistible. 
　 　 
There is no wrong way to do this. 
　 　 
In the experience, you will be guided through a passage in which you find your own way of moving the body.  I don’t ask anyone to move their body in a rhythm, nor engage bodies, nor expect that all the people do the same action. People don’t need to follow a pattern or imitate; it’s experiential. 
　 　 
I give directions based on trust in the body, and what it can manifest. The person will discover how to adapt these directions to their understanding and needs. Maybe someone can move rapidly, maybe another can move slowly, or hardly at all — each one with their own development and course of action. 
　 　 
This workshop focuses on the method of “The Unknown Theater” (El Teatro Desconocido) directed by Juan Carlos De Petre and developed over forty years by a group of people concentrated on exploration of subtle expression. 
　 　 
The practice reveals knowledge; we start from the consciousness of not-knowing — ignorance is the beginning. 
　 　 
This knowledge is experimental and creative; not intellectual, preconceived, acquired through repetition, or memory. Participants will work as a unique being, independent, and according to their own development. You can overcome intimidation and shame; discover empowerment, physical malleability, and grace.
　 　 
Open the door to your body to express the unimaginable.

        <p class="description">This practice is not dance, body expression, theater, nor performance — it is a composition of these, and more. 
 　　 
As human beings we are prepared to communicate with new languages. We will use the intelligence of the movement to communicate. You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). 
 　　 
A morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. 
 　　 
Morphic Field Movement becomes physical expression, borne from body languages, from the poetry of the body, from the clear expression of the bodies. 
 　　 
What I would like to explore is the possibility to express more subtle dimensions of communication, more rare to our usual life; communicating realities that words can not name and the body can reveal. Morphic Field Movement is a proposal to create another type of communication — alternative now, and I hope definitive and more popular in the future.　　 #clothing optional #nudist #naturist</p>

As humans, we like to grasp....everything. Things, people, ideas, beliefs, emotions, the past, the future. If it is within our reach, we want it, we want control of it and we don't want to let it go. 

Unfortunately our attachments often become a roadblock on our journey of life, preventing us from living as the fullest and most beautiful expression of who we are. 

Join us for a conscious conversation around attachment and learn tools to finally RELEASE what is not serving you. Through this process of releasing, we open our hands, our minds and our hearts to the universe and RECEIVE all of her glory 🙏❤️</p>

        <p class="description">Ever wanted to learn the art of weaving scale mail into glorious, glimmering battle gear, costumes, jewelry, or other metal creations? If so, then this is the Renaissance workshop for you! 

Learn the basic weave for linking scales together, as well as a few advanced tips like creating a dart or a reinforced edge that you can apply to more complicated pieces. 

Weaving scale mail is a tedious process, so you won't be leaving with a new vest or shirt, but you should have a small piece (perhaps some earrings or a wrist cuff) that you made during the class that you can wear away to sparkle in the sun.</p>

        <p class="description">The box as art. Contemporary artists have used boxes in a variety of innovative ways.  At face value, the box is a container: for shoes, clothes, a myriad of utilitarian purposes. In the hands of the artist, the box becomes a sculptural form. Inside and outside, the sculptural box is a container for place, memory, and emotion. This talk will provide a survey of how artists have successfully used boxes to create art and inspire attendees to create their own boxes fueled by their experiences in Black Rock City.

        <p class="description">Join us for a guided creative visualization meditation. We will help you picture the perfect day 10 yrs in your future. The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality. You don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it. The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. How? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory "hooks" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel "right". We will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process. After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group. We look forward to sharing your future day together. Dr.Feelgood</p>
