Attach it to your backpack, bike, wrist, or wear it your hair if you would like. Then, as you travel around the city during the rest of the week, keep an eye out for another person wearing a flower in your color. If there is an attraction, go ahead and introduce yourself to that person and if that certain chemistry continues to develop, invite him or her to meet you at the Sleepless In Black Rock City Night party at the Booby Bar in the Terminal City Village right after the burn on Saturday night. Pretty romantic, right?
Supplies will be somewhat limited so don't wait! Come visit us early in the week for the best selections and the longest/most opportunities to meet that someone special. We'll be right next door to The Booby Bar every afternoon/evening until the party for that night gets started. See you there!</p>

WE WILL ONLY BE AT THE MAN FOR 15 MINUTES OR SO THEN MOVE THE EVENT TO OUR CAMP UNTIL ????. Keep an eye out on the bulletin boards prior to the event for postings with exact locations to our camp and our meeting location at 6 o'clock and the MAN. It's not very often that we get to meet geocachers from all over the place in our neck of the woods. What could be better than a dusty playa in the Nevada desert? I can't think of anywhere I'd much rather be?
At least a couple of us will be wearing tye died T-shirts with Great Basin Eastern Sierra Geocachers in large white writing on the back. We plan on meeting at the man and then making our way back to Camp Geosmached for Otter Pops and other yummy breakfast libations!</p>

We do ask that you bring something to share, whether it be ice, food, or drink.  In the past we have had nearly 200 people show up and this year should be no exception.

Any potential name is always discussed and ultimately agreed upon by a quorum of three people before being chosen. Once chosen, a short baptismal ceremony is performed by our very own Master of Ceremonies, a personalized badge is hand-drawn by our resident artists and offered to the person, who then sign or draw their newly-acquired Playa Name in our Book of Names. 

As with last year, passers-by may also choose to have a Tarot Reading from our resident Witch Doctor while waiting. New this year, we will be offering delicious iced tea to quench your playa thirst. Activities will all take place inside our new dome, where you can relax and enjoy.</p>

For our first year as an official camp, bar nights were an epic success. Who could resist? A fiery sign and hot bartenders serving up flaming drinks that scorched the tongue and burned all the way down. For 2010 we're bringing back our classic hot pepper drinks and adding a few more exclusive pours to the Incendiary Intent bar. We kick off the burn on Monday night with an open bar and fire performance, taking in that enthusiasm the first day brings. Lighting up and pouring drinks on Wednesday and Friday, we're sure to get some returning friends and a whole new crowd ready to taste our wicked brews. Fire performers take the stage and dance on the sign.</p>

That doesn't just apply to those of us in camp, there's thousands of people out on the playa that will be getting the mouse-hand shakes by the weekend. Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn't an option, we'll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.

Open to all everyone, gamer or not, we'll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our "Dragonbreath" chili remains, it's a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some "kungaloosh", take down a "sulfuron slammer", and swap war stories of "How I wiped the 40 man raid".</p>

        <p class="description">This is it! The party we have been working toward all week! The Witness Protection Connection: A Dating Service for the Personae non Gratae has been giving out silk flowers all week long representing your sexual preference: white for hetero; red for bi; blue for gay; pink for lesbian; and yellow for transgendered. Hopefully, as you traveled around the city during the week you ran across someone else wearing/displaying a flower matching your color and you introduced yourself. Maybe there was an attraction there and as you parted you invited them to meet you at The Booby Bar in Terminal City village right after the burn on Saturday night. Ah romance! Or maybe the city was just too big and you didn't see another flower all week. No worries! The playa winds will be gently nudging all the flowers back to one of the hottest parties all week. So join the masses in a riot of colors and dance to the best cover songs on the planet!</p>

Or have one of our painters turn you into an Avatar, plenty of blue to go around. Semi-temporary results vary. Caricature artists will also be on hand to draw you up, burner style. Makes a great souvenir! Whether you end up with blue balls or pinkadots all over, join us for an evening of painterly fun.

We also have been creating our own unique, highly renowned, medallions for 8 years this burn. Many residents and BRC Rangers seek us out to renew friendships and get a new medallion every year. This year, we will have a very special medallion. All we ask in return is to show yer bum and get spanked!

All of our activities will take place under a large, inviting, and stimulating
shade structure (night AND day) in front of LAFer Camp with plenty of chairs for residents to get off their feet or bike and chill or play with our paints and other toys—all week long. We have many camp hosts/musicians from across the U.S. of A, that are always ready to fill their cup with a cold beverage or morning hot coffee to help from the previous night's bender, and jaw with passersby.</p>

        <p class="description">Ecstatic Dance is an inner/outer journey of moving meditation. It is a letting go of self-imposed ideas that restrict movement and is an opening to new ways of expression with the body through motion. It develops a direct body-spirit connection in dance. Let your body and inner guide be your teachers. This is about being present with your own energy and discovering your own dance within. Use this movement and energetic experience to release stuck patterns in body, emotions, mind and spirit.</p>

        <p class="description">Contradance every night until dancers or musicians quit (starts after sunset or after burns Sat Sun). Live music - didj, electric fiddle; looped/ trad'nal/ celtic/ fusion/ techno. Fast paced but easy to learn.  We will cycle through different levels - you won't have to wait long for beginner level w/ lessons.  (And there will be a neighboring dance area for those who prefer to freestyle.)  A caller instructs but there is room for dancers to improvise. 1/2 the moves w/ your partner, 1/2 w/ everyone else. No need to bring a partner (dancers swap partners after every dance).  Zen is flow, synchrony, bonding (not footwork, not competition).  If you are smiling, you are doing it right. 

Because couples flow through one another in long lines and end up interacting with everyone, it has a very tribal feel–w/ bonding through synchronous stomping, clapping and hooting.  It is very playful (variations and flourishes improvised ad lib) and flirtatious.  Dancers typically include all ages from children to the elderly, and include people with a surprising range of disabilities.  Dancers and callers frequently swap gender roles, and playfully mock gender conventions.

The caller gives instructions for each dance's particular repeating cycle of ~10 moves.  The basic moves are very easy to learn, but lessons are necessary for advanced moves, and so that new dancers don't become disoriented, and can more quickly get to the point of enjoying the flow.  We will use a LCD projector and screen to get dancers up to speed as quickly as possible.  While the caller explains individual moves and line movement verbally, the screen will show them diagrammatically from above, and w/ POV video of real dancers from the side.   

Slippery shoes are helpful.  A less than full stomach will make it easier for some to avoid dizziness.  Dancers expect to adjust their behavior to suit each person they meet in the line (e.g. just ask for minimal spinning or whatever else makes you comfortable).</p>

        <p class="description">Zaireeka Listening Party: Experiments with Sound, Revival
Zaireeka is the eighth studio album by the alternative rock band The Flaming Lips. Released on October 28, 1997, the experimental rock album consists of four compact discs. Each of its eight songs consists of four stereo tracks, one from each CD. The album was designed so that when played simultaneously on four separate audio systems, the four CDs would produce a harmonic or juxtaposed sound. The discs may be included in different combinations, omitting one, two or three discs. The album's title is a portmanteau of two words: Zaire, chosen as a symbol of anarchy after Wayne Coyne heard a radio news story about the political instability of the African nation, and eureka (literally: "I have found it"), an expression of joyous discovery.
Since its release a fifth disc has been added, adding a new element to the experiment.
Leading up to it's release, the Lips would conduct parking garage, and ballroom experiments using car stereos and boom boxes to coordinate massive simultaneous sound experiments using the sounds that would eventually become Zaireeka.
I propose to invite any interested booxbox/ mp3player toting burners to bring along their audio device, I will distribute the 5 discs (sets of mp3s) to everyone, divided up into groups, and (huddle into the dome perhaps) for some freaked out sounds. i will act as conductor, signaling when each group is to crank their disc, etc. we can try can waves of volume, mix up groups, or keep them segregated, their are many options left open for these wacky tracks!</p>

        <p class="description">The vision of Camp Nomadia is to bring together as many cool nomadic spirits as we can to share stories, resources, passion, and community. To foster nomadic community, we are hosting a Nomadic Happy Hour on Tuesday and Thursday (4pm to 6pm) and Sunday (3pm to 5pm).

Come and stop by - whether you are a current nomad, future nomad, wanna-be nomad, full-time nomad, part time nomad, domestic nomad, international nomad, technomad, lowtechnomad, former nomad, land nomad, rail nomad, backpacking nomad, open water cruising nomad, friend of a nomad, or you just want to be around nomads.

Bring some food or drink to share, and come mix and mingle. Tour a few truly mobile homes. Learn what it is like to live full-time on the road. Ask questions. Swap stories. Or just come hang out and meet some cool folk.

Camp Nomadia is intentionally unplaced this (our third) year, so check for our on-playa location at Playa Info (and likely on our website as well) and come find us.  Last year we had over 70 nomads from all around the world camped with us, and we are looking forward to another great year in 2010!

BTW -- If you are interested in a life of nomadism, come early on Thursday for our "Technomadic Lifestyle Workshop" just before Happy Hour, running 3pm - 4pm.</p>

It has been a long day of building, breaking and fixing, but the sun has gone down, so leave what you need to do and come on down to the Darwin Fish Tank.

        <p class="description">To sweat is to pray, to make an offering of your innermost self. Sweat is holy water, prayer beads, pearls of liquid that release your past. . . . Sweat is an ancient and universal form of self healing, whether done in the gym, the sauna, or the sweat lodge. We do it on the dance floor. The more you dance, the more you sweat. The more you sweat, the more you pray. The more you pray, the closer you come to ecstasy. - Gabrielle Roth Sweat and pray with Masha as she guides you through Gabrielle Roth's 5Rhythms - flowing, staccato, chaos, lyrical and stillness.</p>

Why: It is written, “...On this day in the 25th year of our Burning Man, after years of coin slots, game shows, and endless ridicule, the tribe known as ‘The Lost Peoples of Nevada’ finally descended once again from their motel rooms and trailer parks, ushering freely and loudly amongst all the other tribes from the uppity world, to that place known among the ancients as Black Rock City, Nevada, ...and in unison, striking a defiant pose before THE MAN!

A fiery sign and hot bartenders serving up flaming drinks that scorched the tongue and burned all the way down. In 2011 we're bringing back our classic hot pepper drinks and adding a few more exclusive pours to the Incendiary Intent bar. Lighting up and pouring drinks on Wednesday and Friday, we're sure to get some returning friends and a whole new crowd ready to taste our wicked brews. Fire performers take the stage and dance on the sign.</p>

That doesn’t just apply to those of us in camp, there’s thousands of people out on the playa that will be getting the mouse-hand shakes by the weekend. Since popping up the laptop and logging on isn’t an option, we’ll just have ourselves an addiction party instead.

Open to all everyone, gamer or not, we’ll have a little gathering Saturday afternoon. Anyone who has completed our daily quests, or just wants to hang out and get their fix is welcome. Our resident mad alchemist has come up with some special brews, and servings of delicious chocolate cake are available to all. If any of our "Dragonbreath" chili remains, it’s a great time to polish that off. Hang out, drink some "kungaloosh", take down a "sulfuron slammer", and swap war stories of "How I wiped the 40 man raid".</p>

We will play our version of Spin the bottle which we call Spin the monkey.  Meet your future ex-playa girlfriend in a friendly, safe sexy space.  Our dome is women-identified 24/7. Bring your own cup. 


"Camp Beaverton: Camp for Wayward Girls" is an intentional (and experimental) Burning Man community camp AND conversation. For who? For Gay and Queer Women (identified), Dykes, Bykes, Sluts, Butches, Bois, Trannies, Lesbians, Geekster-Hip Lezzies, Lesbos, Lipstick Lesbians, the Bi-identified, the Bi-curious, the Hetero-flexible, and even (gasp!) the occasional Straight Girl (as long as she's as Wayward as the playa is dusty). We are thouroughly queer, yet inclusive, with a definite chick-centric bent. Participation, inquiry, conversation, and owning your stuff are the name of the game.

Our intention is to provide two things: a kick-ass Queer Oasis in Black Rock City for girls who LOVE girls, and a continuing conversation exploring female and feminine queer sexuality in the world and in BRC. Participatory in nature, Camp Beaverton, whether online or on the Playa, is a place where you are encouraged to explore YOUR expression of queerness and allow the rest of us to ask "What is MINE?"</p>

        <p class="description">Camp Beaverton for Wayward Girls is your queer oasis in BRC.  Join us for an old fashioned Lesbian Mixer in the dessert.  We will play our version of Spin the bottle which we call Spin the monkey.  Meet your future ex-playa girlfriend in a friendly, safe sexy space.  Our dome is women-identified 24/7. Bring your own cup. 


"Camp Beaverton: Camp for Wayward Girls" is an intentional (and experimental) Burning Man community camp AND conversation. For who? For Gay and Queer Women (identified), Dykes, Bykes, Sluts, Butches, Bois, Trannies, Lesbians, Geekster-Hip Lezzies, Lesbos, Lipstick Lesbians, the Bi-identified, the Bi-curious, the Hetero-flexible, and even (gasp!) the occasional Straight Girl (as long as she's as Wayward as the playa is dusty). We are thouroughly queer, yet inclusive, with a definite chick-centric bent. Participation, inquiry, conversation, and owning your stuff are the name of the game.</p>

Join our tongue-in-cheek homage to the age old Jewish rite of passage into adulthood (Must be 21 and over with ID). Sponsored by the "NYC Fetish Tribe", expect an irreverent event filled with fun twists. The Party Naked Rab-Bar will have Rabbis serving Manischewitz. Meet our authentic Jewish Mother, present to dispense guilt and advice whether you want it or not. Make your own Yamulkah or join in a game of Strip Dreidel (beloved Hanukkah game with an adult twist). We will dance the hora, a traditional folk dance commonly known to break out spontaneously during Jewish parties and escalate in speed and enthusiasm to the point of ecstasy.  During This celebratory circle dance, random revelers are pulled into the center of the circle, seated in chairs and hoisted in the air by other dancers. Sin City will infuse these age old customs with hedonism and humor and bring to the Playa a RITE OF PASSAGE we like to call THE BURN MITZVAH.</p>

If you're a first-timer, here's the drill:  we meet at the Man and have a cocktail or two.  Then we ride off on a meandering tour of the city.  Six host camps along the route will keep the icy cocktails flowing.

We’ll have mugs for the first 300 riders but bring a cup just in case.

Our host camps this year will be Comfort & Joy, Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Tribe, The Duck Pond, and the Naked Tiki Bar.

Sunshine, alcohol, and blatant public nudity...  It’s a playa tradition!  Find us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=147170995353172</p>

First commissioned as The Yellow Submarine during Metropolis, she has been rechristened in a further wave of nostalgia for a time long past.

A word from her Captain, Boris Yuri Oswald Breszhnev:  "Komrades, this manifestation of Cold War memories will take you back to the glory daze of the CCCP, the mass hysteria of the cattle Americans, imperialist Nixon and Reagan nationalism, and the detente of global thermonuclear war always just around the corner.

BRS prioritizes installations for schools, hospitals, rural communities, non-profit groups, and Native American tribes. We’ve also teamed up with other environmental organizations in GREENevada to provide student education and teacher support.  At our 2011 Solar Summit, you will meet the staff and crew of Black Rock Solar as well as other Burners doing meaningful and innovative work around the country. Tell us about your projects and learn about ours. The purpose of this event is to bring together all of the different groups and individuals on playa doing work in renewable energy, climate change, environmental outreach and policy.

        <p class="description">Ventucky Burners present their 4th Annual OPEN HOUSE Thong Party! Meet in the SIGN POST FOREST for a sampling of our signature "Blaster" elixir & celebrate the debut of Miss ThongLove's 2011 thong collection. This year's collection is sure to "blow" your mind. Come early to claim an original work of thong-art! While you're there, learn about the SIGN POST FOREST and help it grow. COME FIND WHO YOU DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE MISSING! We've made it easy to build community on and off the Playa. You can find people right from your own hometown by creating a groovy fluorescent sign and posting it with your hometown and Playa address. As other BRC citizens visit the forest, they will add their Playa address to the back of the sign, too! Check back frequently to see who's in your hood, and arrange a meet-up with all the beautiful people you didn't know before! We'll be hosting signpost workshops ad hoc all day on Tuesday and Wednesday. And be sure to visit the Sign Post Forest at night for a spectacular UV experience!</p>

waist beads to wear on the Playa.

For centuries waist beads and decorative chains have been worn by women and men of many cultures. They are worn by belly dancers for traditional Arabic Dance. Egyptian waist-bands were worn by men.

African women wear waist beads to celebrate femininity, fertility, healing, spirituality, balancing and energy. The Seven Chakras share many of these aspects—balance, healing, love, sexuality, courage, self discipline, creativity, and enlightenment. Wrap all these wonderful feelings and energy around your waist and wear them day and night on the Playa.</p>

Our open air theater will showcase the best short films from around the world to an international audience of art and film lovers who descend on Burning Man each year for fun, art, and experience in the Nevada desert.

Black Rock Film Fest 2011 will kick off with a Red Carpet Opening Night Gala before the first program on Tuesday night and conclude with a Wrap Party after the last films on Friday night. Before every screening we will host a cocktail hour at our Casting Couch Bar. The Black Rock Film Fest will also host a live performance from The Zebbler Encanti Experience. 

The Black Rock Film Fest (formerly known as BRC International Film Festival) began as a collaboration between SF IndieFest and BUFF, the organizations responsible for the annual San Francisco Independent Film Festival, SF Documentary Film Fest, Another Hole in the Head, and the Boston Underground Film Festival. The organizers have collectively produced over 40 film festivals.</p>

Join women, men, and children of all genders to celebrate and honor the truth that true sacred celebration includes the profane and the spiritual! Locking people out and locking out celebrations of being alive locks us all out from our sacred humanity.

Celebrate our shadows and our light as we dance, imbibe, eat fruit and chocolate, and have an altogether fucking good time.

Please bring food, drink, music, and yourselves to share!

The event shall be located a respectful distance from the post-Critical Tits women-only ritual, first couple of Art Cars there pick a spot for us.

No polo shirts, khakis, or denim, and no photos without permission!  You totally suck if you do this.

Be respectful, participate, dress up, have fun!</p>

Besides having paints available all week, we will also be doing Random Karaoke! Get your Bon Jovi on and remember that no matter how bad you think you sing, it stays on the playa! If you have a song or songs you want played on the playa send a request beforehand to reboot (at) website-wishes (dot) com. He'll have it ready for you.

We also have hula hoops, boing ball, and assorted beach games always going on.

Oh, and did I mention our medallions?? This year we will have laser engraved bone medallions! Created & designed by our resident, Boner. He is a softy at heart.

And finally, our curbside chill zone is always open for passersby. Come by and be a Lazy Ass Fucker (LAFer) like the rest of us, if only for the week. Hey, it takes a lot to be a LAFer!

In 2011 the Grand Hotel is being given a shake, stir and a dash of down-under distinction by the Coco Poco Loco Corporation of Melbourne, Australia. 

Coco Poco Loco is a mob of misfits, musicians, marauders, and masters of their own mayhem who have unleashed their wild spirits, unstoppable enthusiasm, and gratis cocktails across Australian festivals. In keeping with this year’s theme, Ashram Galactica have gifted the opportunity and rite of passage for Coco Poco Loco to take their gifting to new heights on a new continent and into a new galaxy.

Each night there will be drinks served at the bar along with authentic Aussie canapés, a live extravaganza from Alt-polka-gypsy-pirate band 8foot Felix, a medley of tunes from guest and resident DJs, as well as a show-stopping show!

        <p class="description">“This Is Not The Camp You Are Looking For” is committed to participatory community building. To that end, we spent time considering the internal gifts our camp has to give, the needs of our community-of-Burners-at-large, the theme that will encompass all of us on the playa this year, and how to make people laugh.


Thus, we bring you: QUICKIE RITES OF PASSAGE.


The human experience, our shared experience on this Earth, is synonymous with change. The Rites of Passage that all peoples, modern and ancient, have concocted to navigate those changes, deserve  a place on the playa. Our camp believes that Rites of Passage, while critically important to human development, need not be painful. Who needs the long, drawn-out pain of childbirth, adolescence or divorce? Go through it quickly and painlessly at our walk-up service for Quickie Rites of Passage! Want a wedding without the stress of planning? No problem! We’ll have you hitched in under 5 minutes. Terrible time as a teen? Painful journey through your mother's birth canal? Awful first day of Kindergarten? Tripped on your gown at your college graduation? Want to be divorced from your playa partner RIGHT NOW? No problem!!! We'll complete or re-enact all of these rites -- and more -- in five minutes or less!"


Join us at “This Is Not The Camp You Are Looking For” on Friday and Saturday from 1pm to 3pm. Quickie Rites of Passage will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. Suitable costuming for all rites will be made available by our camp and we make absolutely no guarantee that they will be appropriate -- only amusing.</p>

We will gather at Esplinade directly in front of center camp at 10:30AM on Thursday September 1st and walk to our designated spot nearby on the playa where everyone will get into place and create an enormous HUMAN/ALIEN SMILEY FACE (visible from the air.) 

This is a chance to gather amongst strangers and friends and participate in a legitimate Guinness World Record attempt- and also to create Joy in the process. 

Once in formation, participants only need to stay in place for 10 minutes while the photos and video documentation will be taking place from the air. Then we will dis-assemble and celebrate!

The whole event should take under an hour.</p>

Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else, resulting in a tribal vibe, where the Zen is flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition). Sunset - midnightish (later if everyone keeps going), except Sat starts 30 min after the man falls, Sun starts 60 min after the temple burn begins. Kid friendly.</p>

The Mener is no stranger to the world of electronic music. Since his first introduction to the party scene in the winter of 1993, he has been addicted to the music. He soon immersed himself in many aspects of the party scene and started breakdancing and doing graffiti, but didn’t start DJ’ing until 1997. 

Around 1996, he was throwing raves and was opening his own shows by playing his first musical love: hip hop. After seeing how much more the crowd responded to house and breaks, the transition of musical choice was swift and the first emergence of the DJ we now know as The Mener was born. Since his humble beginnings, The Mener has been throwing down funky house and breaks sets in most major cities in the U.S. and has opened for a colossal list of international superstars. 

Whether it be 50 people or 5,000 people, rest assured this 14 year turntable veteran knows how to destroy dancefloors!</p>

        <p class="description">Since the dawn of time men and women have been enraptured by the sacred dance, spiraling into the heights of ecstacy and submerging into the depths of soulful bliss. By communing with the vixen within, she channels this energy, adds some sub-bass and creates a gypsy infused sauce of luscious whomp. Like a soft caress down the back of your neck, delicate twinklings of sultry highs lull dancers into a sonic womb, only to be enticed back into throbbing convulsions by another of her glitched out dubstep hip hop/gypsy infused bassy beats

Dj Jocelyn promises that she will increase the chance of your evening's coupling with that of sheer wild fun and yum. As the visionary co-founder and producer of Club Exotica she is sure to offer her sexy, gutteral, grinding, liquid-lithe mixes to lift the party's spirit ever higher. She drives your consciousness deep into your hips while furtive, cantankerous, sly, smiles blossom radiantly and dart from your eyes only to incorrigibly drape across your lips.</p>

A fiery sign and hot bartenders serving up flaming drinks that scorched the tongue and burned all the way down. In 2012 we're bringing back our classic hot pepper drinks and adding a few more exclusive pours to the Incendiary Intent bar. Lighting up and pouring drinks on Wednesday and Friday, we're sure to get some returning friends and a whole new crowd ready to taste our wicked brews. Fire performers take the stage and dance on the sign.</p>

        <p class="description">ALIA can take a room into deep ecstasy with her bright energy and serpentine movements drawing from her training as a dance performer and her devotion to embodying the feminine, never playing anything that she herself won't move to. 

She has had a life-long love affair with music and dance - they are her spiritual practice and her most potent passions. ALIA transmits the bliss she experiences in performances to create a connected, alive and activated experience that evokes the sacred and awakens our connection to our source through rhythm and movement. She approaches every set as a ritual and as a facilitator of dance floor unity. 

ALIA has shared the stage with the likes of Beats Antique, Random Rab, Govinda, Freq Nasty, Marty Party, An-ten-nae, Heyoka, Pussymonster, Sasha Rose, Vibesquad, DJ Jocelyn, and Bay Area favorite DJ Dragonfly.

        <p class="description">Each year since 2004, hundreds of naked burners meet at the Man to consume a little liquid courage, and pedal off into the City for a few hours of bar hopping.  Six host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the ride participants.  We’ll be stopping off at Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Camp Swede, and the Tiki Bar.  How many naked cyclists can we squeeze into a tiki bar?  Come help us break last year’s record.  We’ll also be hitting Duckpond for keg beer and some slip-’n-slide action.  As always, the famous naked bartenders of Comfort & Joy will be hosting the after party.  This ride isn’t just an event, it’s a tradition.  So if you’re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the silliest parties on the playa.  Trust us, after the first couple of cocktails you won’t mind being naked. 

If you're interested in helping to steward the ride, contact us at dunneasley@hotmail.com.  We can always use more rider wranglers.</p>

        <p class="description">We have put together one of the best Dark Side of the Moon/ Wizard of Oz mashups you will ever see.  
We researched and experimented with many albums to complete the movie.  Be sure to stay to The End for 
one of the most perfect synchronizations in the entire movie!

synchronize: To cause (soundtrack and action) to match exactly in a film.
synchronicity: Coincidence of events that seem to be meaningfully related, 
conceived in Jungian theory as an explanatory principle on the same order as causality.

This mashup is a sublime example of synchronization and synchroncity.  

Synchronicity bewteen albums and movies is relatively easy to find. Often times the mood of a musical
piece can be flexible enough to fit with many scenes in a movie.  But in this case, the mood of 
the various Pink Floyd albums across the course of the scenes in The Wizard of Oz seem to synchronize 
with the mood of the movie perfectly.

Synchronization is more difficult to find between an album and a movie. Of course you can adjust the start
point of a movie to create artificial synchronizations but you would not necessarily expect many other
components to align.   However, in this mashup you find absolutely amazing synchronized scenes.  At the risk
of spoiling some surprises ... be sure to pay attention to the music and in particular the timing of the silences 
after Dorothy's house lands in Oz.  Also, pay attention to the ends of songs and note how more often than not
the song ends align with scene ends.  The synchronizations is so tight it makes you wonder how this could ever be 
conicidence.  Was this designed by Pink Floyd?  All band members vehemently deny this.

We will have some seating available but you also might want to consider bringing a chair/blanket/pillow.

The movie will start at 8:30PM (after sunset when full dark has set in.)</p>

        <p class="description">Kostume Kult has been "Costuming the Naked" since 2002 with donations from costume companies, theater groups and burners like you who help us recycle their old costumes and freaky fashions. Here we empower people with new attitude to be birthed down our runway, with the encouragement of our MCs and DJs, onto the Esplanade and into their new lives.

The rules are simple. 
 
1. The stuff is free.  No returns or barter required although we do encourage recycling old costumes through us. 

2. You must wear what you want to take with you.  We are not giving "product" but "experience" and transformation is what is being offered-- not a consumerist feeding frenzy. (Decommodification)
 
3.  If you have found something truly wonderful that makes your heart go pitter-patter... Consider giving it to the person next to you.  Generosity trumps the accumulation of stuff. (Gifting)

4.  If you are looking for something specific, coming in with an agenda, you will not find it.  We aint got it. (and we might actually hide it from you! ;) Come in with an open mind to mix and match and be silly (Immediacy).

4.  Donated costumes can be moopy.  Please help us keep the playa perfect and consciously dispose of all tags, loose threads and packaging. (Leave No Trace)

5. Go forth onto the playa ready to participate and express yourself more fully.  Costume is the mix of fashion and theater and the playa is one big-ass stage.  After our runway, be prepared to make new connections in your new costumed persona or upgraded burner attitude.  (Participation and Radical Self Expression)</p>

        <p class="description">Most all of us that live here in Nevada were born in another state, nation, galaxy, time, or universe.  

Everyone that goes to Burning Man come from different places, and then they go home afterwards.  

But we stay and love it here in wonderfully strange Nevada.

The fact is, there are more Nevada Burners per capita than any other nation in the universe -- but there will be all these Burning Man Virgins this year playing in our backyard!

It's that time again.  It's time to take it to The Man and let him, and everyone else know, who we are, and where in the hell we stand, dammit...

AlieNVation!

Please join your fellow Nevada Burners in Black Rock City for a distinguished group photo at 4pm SHARP on Thurdsay, August 30, at The Man (6:00 side).

Of course, please don your finest what-not as representative of being a so-called "Nevadan," hahaha!

Participarty will ensue surrounding this photo shoot.  Mingling, stories, amazing feats, rousing spirituals, ...and booze and music too!

Please bring all your fellow Nevada Burner kin, from whatever state, nation, or planet they originally sprouted from.

The group photo will be freely available to download following the Burning Man, and you can still see the photos of previous years, all here:

No duds & no repeats like last year!!  Although I won't be sober, I have it arranged that a semi-sentient being will start the music on time!  Our trusty old favorite, tasty Ritz Crackers will be served.
You're on your own for cocktails although we usually bend the knee and pour a few for old friends as we spy them.  Also on the scene- our World Map that you can sign to make your attendance mark for all to see. Also our Playa famous gift tree, chock-a-block full of useful survival items.</p>

This is not a gallery, it is more like juvenile detention for art, an orphanage, a half-way house for misfit art. All art in the Home is up for adoption, all the prospective new parent needs to do is fill out a small adoption form and clip it to the Home in place of their newfound art darling. Art may also be committed to the Home, just put it securely in place and say good-bye. While the emphasis is on visual art such as paintings, drawings and photos, sculptural art and trinkets found their way into the Home last year and then found new homes. Daytime only.</p>

We have provided a motel motif that includes clean bedding, an ice bucket, and other classic motel environs to promote what adults do in such situations.  At the same time, their shadows are projected on the fabric walls to entertain the outside guests with their ‘shadow play.’  This is the perfect melding of the voyeurs and exhibitionists that populate BRC.  For many of our previous guests, our motel has provided them an opportunity to do something they may have only dream of prior, but in a playful and anonymous manner.  This is our contribution to what we consider one of the most important aspects to a great BM experience; it is not a spectator sport!

You must be 21 or over to Party here and we do ask for and check ID's (it's always good to carry your ID while at Burning Man). We start the mornings with Bloody Mary's at 9:00am until we run out. We then dispense our "Tiki Punch" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Party Naked Tiki Bar is the clothing optional bar that rewards your getting naked. This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that "do it". Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.</p>

Firewands can be used on the body as a sensual massage as well as major body experience in trust and sensuality.  The Violet wand has to be one of the most versatile and clever kink toys – join us for a game of violet wand operation (remember the game from your childhood – well it has evolved)…or just a quick taste to see if you like it.  We have been teaching and tasting with these for over 5 years and look forward to answering your questions and showing you a brave new world to explore on the Playa (and elsewhere)!</p>

Each year, we do nothing more than create a fun jungle-vibe space where you can get your feet (and body should you desire) rubbed, and share a shot of tequila with us. The Leopard Lounge runs on the kindness of strangers, so we also welcome you to join our staff and participate in the gifting of a footrub or massage, just be sure to do so with respect to personal boundaries. If you have other gifts to share: food, musical talent, energy work, manicure/pedicure, hair braiding, readings, etc., the Leopard Lounge is a great place to park yourself and offer your services. No scheduling or expectations, just gratitude for however long you want to contribute. The vibe is all things Jungle, Safari, Animal, so dress the part if you can!</p>

We teach tango and blues classes, follow them up with practice time, then happy hour (often with live music), and dances in the evenings.  Tango milongas are Monday and Wednesday, Blues dances on Tuesday and Thursday.

In our classes, you'll learn how to do these two social partner dances, how to connect with the music and your partner, how to relax, you'll get to meet and interact with your playa brethren, and you'll dance a bunch.

During the guided practice time, you'll have a chance to practice during the day and ask questions of the experienced dancers hanging out.

At happy hour, grab a drink, dance and chill. Listen to live music if we have a drop-in musician (or let us know if you you'd like to play some blues or tango music at our camp).

And then in the evening, dress up, and come dance the night away.  We keep the music running at all hours.</p>

Two weeks later, I found The Funk in bed with Dr. LeTawdry and a conger eel. At first, I thought it was a sea anemone, but under closer inspection, I realized it was a funky balls o' tits from outer space! I'm Old Gregg.

Thanks to George Clinton and a Himalayan sherpa with a choice DVD collection and a bad case of dermatitis, The Mighty Boosh comes to the Playa, where Old Gregg and The Hitcher tend to frequent. Who knows what will happen, but it's guaranteed to be epic! I'm Old Greggggggggg!!</p>

        <p class="description">About the fourth day of Burning Man - 2012, God got a little bored.  Being all knowing and all seeing, he already had had his Wednesday melt down of too much dust and sun, and needed a pick Him up.  He’d taken a liking to Camp Brand Ur Ass, and its Houston contingent, the Rubber Chicken Camp - because Rubber Chickens are inherently funny; almost as funny as giraffes.  Anywho, He gave them the idea a couple of years ago to host a Lemon Heaven party - (omnipotent, remember? Sort of like Doctor Who, but without the TARDIS) and knew they’d picked up some lemons, vodka (for those of you wary of mixing), and some powdered lemon stuff, and said, “Yea, verily, thou shalt host another LEMON HEAVEN PARTY!” That was in his most impressive god voice.  He also knew they played excellent, party dance music. So, everyone who’s anyone, please join the Rubber Chicken Camp, at Camp Brand Ur Ass, on Thursday evening around 7-ish.</p>

Sure, that could have been the tequila talking, but tequila knows a good party, so you should listen when it speaks.  Bring your sombrero, dancing shoes, and a cup and join the conga line from camp out to the party on the playa.  If you miss the train, swing by camp for the exact location of the event.

We love it so much that we built a "cuddling oasis" - a space where one can take a break, chill, relax, and snuggle - with loved ones or complete strangers - at all times of day or night.

Dubbed the Cuddle Dome, our cuddling space offers a plethora of implements to maximize you comfort and cuddling awesomeness.

Cuddling awesomeness, say you? Who wouldn't want to cuddle suspended 10 feet in the air under the starry Playa sky? (yes, we have a Sky Loft)

And of course we have pillows and blankets. Lots of 'em!

Vancouver, Victoria, Bellingham, Seattle plus surrounding areas & any of our friends!
Wouldn't it be nice to be sure to catch at least ONE SUNRISE?
Wouldn't it be nice to share that with the people you know from the default world?
That's what WE THOUGHT!

An annual tradition, the last several years’ Wednesday morning PNW gatherings have been really great! An opportunity to see many people that you otherwise might not see at any other time during the week... Several people said they really appreciated the callout, as it ensured that they would catch at least ONE sunrise! And it's a sweet time to visit the Temple, mid-week, mid-progress with everyone adding their words & thoughts...

Meet you at the Temple, sunrise side, on Wednesday at 6am, & we'll watch the sun rise together.
Nice & simple, bring whatever you feel to share, or not!
Invite your friends, campmates, associates... & we'll see you there.

Bride Ride 2012, donning our chosen bridal attire (you are the bride), so pack a wedding dress.  

Past, present, future, imagined, symbolic, playful, silly, reflective, contemplative, joyous, heavy hearted, fulfilled, disappointed, younger, older brides are all welcome...come one, come all......come in your choice of playa wedding attire (something old, new, borrowed, or blue, bought for the ride, or have had on hand, whatever you choose).  

The plan is to gather for a sisterhood sunset ride and to celebrate fertility, womanhood, sisterhood, life, love, friendship, femininity, beauty or reflect, dream, remember, mourn, manifest.  It's all welcome. 

We will take a bike ride around the playa, route to be determined, and eventually make our way around to the temple to end our ride.

According to the Dreams Dictionary “To see wedding clothes, signifies you will participate in pleasing works and will meet new friends.”  So let’s make a "playa-dream" together, make new friends, find our own personal meaning in this symbolic act and in the process create some playa beauty too.

Meet in front of Camp RhythmWave, slated to be 4:45pm and Foxglove.</p>

Enjoy ginger snaps, orange jello shots, and ginger beer as we drink until we're red in the face.  What happens when people of such rare pedigree party together?  Who knows!  It's never happened!  We can discuss our favorite red heads, play 'find the freckle,' and maybe even have a conan obrian look-alike contest!  Maybe it'll be a raucous shit show or maybe just a mob of burners constantly reapplying sun screen.  Let's find out!  With hundreds of gingers on the playa we're also looking to break the record for most gingers in a single place; the previous record is six. Note: Severely sun burnt burners do not count.  Also, this is a safe environment for gingers so no red-head-fetish onlookers please (unless you're a ginger too, in which case come on in).  If you're name is Ginger you can come we suppose.</p>

        <p class="description">We are on a mission for creative and consciousness-awakening ideas for the ‘New World’. The Mayan prophesy states that we are approaching the end of an age in 2012 – this is a time of transition from one World Age into another. The message they give concerns our choice of how we enter the future ahead. How we cross this threshold will determine how we transition into the coming age.The American nation has already seen a taste of what is to come from other nations, with a gradual decline in standards, increased unemployment and the real-estate and industrial collapse. Coinciding with the ending of the Mayan calendar in December 2012, we feel there is an increased public focus on world events which acts as a catalyst for major change.This project documents the progression of the fulfillment of our objective – collecting entries for The New World Manifesto. Contributions to the manifesto will be personally delivered to the ‘Gods of the Elements’ in Chichen Itza on the 21st December 2012.We are bringing the question to you; How do you want to enter this new age? This project is designed so that people from around the world can contribute to the Manifesto. We will be:-Creating an online documentary series, event log and blog of our voyage.-Uploading content daily that you can comment on and participate in.-Searching for contributors for our ‘new world manifesto’.-Interviewing people from a cross-section of American society.-Filming the ‘making-of’ documentary feature film for release in Feb. 2013.The story is narrated by five leading characters - a cabaret performer, a reporter, an actor, a cook and an artist. They will be Accompanied by the 3 crew members, the cinematographers / photographers.In each documentary episode, the interviewees will be asked about their vision of the ‘New World’ and will be offered the opportunity to enter their wishes into The Manifesto. We are all creating our future right now! So let's do it together!</p>

What is a haberdashery, you ask?  It's a fine gentlemen's clothier.  Often times, a hat shop. Or according to the Urban Dictionary...
haberdashery:(n.) Foolish and absurd shenanigans often committed in a social setting. Alcoholic beverages are a popular catalyst to the occurrence of such foolishness.

Come play and visit a bit at the on Playa meet and greet. This will be a time to just chill in the shade and visit with people from our group,community, people walking by or just to that cuttie over there (that's me haha). A layed back place to get your social butterfly going and get out of the heat. I will be pulling people on skies behind my art boat before this is all over. Come over and visit us and let's relax and congregate together.

I do need some help from you all on here. No money needed but I will ask this, since I do not have it in the budget for mass booze (some booze just not a mass) and beer, I must ask that you bring your cup and whatever you have laying around your camp that will get you off and that you are willing to share with you friend here at the Burners Against Scalpers Party. If you have extra, and want to donate to this on playa event, just bring it to the meet and greet and we can mix it into something. Also if anyone wants to help plan this and kick it off, I welcome ideas and more ideas. I am not the best planner of events so please give your ideas and maybe your help setting up or planning or what ever...see you all there.</p>

        <p class="description">Come to the "On the Red Carpet" Premiere to watch the results of the Black Rock City 48 Hour Film Project! Each of these movies was made in 48 hours on the Playa. "Cinderplaya" features a wizard searching for his Playa love. "Portaman" discovers a mastermind's plan to destroy Burningman. "Sister Lucy" helps Burners learn about sex. During "Abandon All Hope and Fear", a dream teaches the way of the Playa. More movies will be included. The 48 Hour Film Project's mission is to advance filmmaking and promote filmmakers. Through its festivals the Project encourages filmmakers and would-be filmmakers to get out there and make movies. The tight deadline of 48 hours puts the focus squarely on the filmmakers—emphasizing creativity and teamwork skills. While the time limit places an unusual restriction on the filmmakers, it is also liberating by putting an emphasis on "doing" instead of "talking." At Videogasm in Snowflake Village at 8:15 & Edelweiss. Bring your own chair or tarp. Note, to join the BRC 48 Hour Film Project to help make a film, come to the kick-off at Videogasm on Tuesday, August 28th between 3-5 PM.</p>

we bring some soul to BRC with the SOULPLEX, a live music venue and groove factory. Inspired by the soultrain, we felt the playa could use just a little more live music... that wasn't dub step. Playing tunes from James Brown to The Temptations, Sly and The Family Stone to Kool And The Gang...and even some Stevie Wonder and the Four Tops.

Come groove, get your boogie down, and meditate to the beats of the fro… just make sure to take off your fucking shoes. If you are a singer or musician (horn player, guitarist, keys, etc) - come join the show. We've got a backing band and all the gear (unless that is you play horns) - so come say hi anytime during the week or just show up for the party.</p>

In ancient times, Egyptians believed all forms of life were believed to have been created by RA, the Sun God, who called each of them into existence by speaking their secret names. Humans were created from RA's tears and sweat.

The Egyptians often referred to the sun and the moon as the "eye"s of particular gods. RA's right eye was equated with the sun, and his left eye equated with the moon.

The Eye of RA therefore, can also take the form of a goddess: the mother who brings RA forth. RA was sometimes said to enter the body of the sky goddess at sunset, impregnating her and setting the stage for his rebirth at sunrise.

In the spirit of Fertility 2.0, we must pay homage to RA at night with the moon in full, before he is born again at dawn Friday morning.

Egyptian attire is requested for our evening Eye of Ra party. Come as Cleopatra, Marc Anthony, Pharaoh, or any of your favorite Ancient Egyptian Gods and Goddesses to prove your dedication to Ra and be protected until eternity.

9 PM Jonny Quest

2 AM Donald Glaude 
3 AM Hatiras

6 AM Dustin Sheridan 

And your dedication to RA by displaying your Egyptian attire will not go unnoticed, as the Eye of RA sees all. Please find the arm of RA, a Pharaoh by the name of Cameron and he will reward you with a playa gift amulet that would make RA himself jealous. 

I now bid you safe passage on your way from the default world to our underworld.</p>

Calling all Teddy Bears, Teddy Bares, Mad Hatters and assorted Great British & Non-British Eccentrics:

Because only Mad Dogs & Englishmen are out in the midday sun, come and join us on Friday, 31st August from 2.30 pm for a picnic afternoon tea all set to some jolly good tunes brought to you from Dave’s Disco, Lexi Fey, The Prince of Rinse and other guest DJs to be announced. 

Expect copious amounts of Pimms and tea which MUST be drunk with pinkie akimbo to wash down that oh so refined of all British morsels – the cucumber sandwich! Along with assorted other high-tea culinary delights to wrap your stiff upper lip around.

All will be wowed with a cornucopia of amusements in the original British game show “Crystal Tipps’ Maze”. There will be gifts for winners & forfeits for runners-up! (Draws will be decided with tickleathons & thumb wars).

Crystal Tipps’ Maze is a group game to be played in teams. Challenges will be physical, mental, environmental, sensual & luck-based. The game will comprise five rounds – the exact content of the rounds will be decided on the day but will be chosen from those published below:

1. Village fete – apple bobbing, hoops horseshoe throwing, hook-a-duck, tom bola, raffle, lucky dip,

2. Parlour games - Pin the tail on the donkey, playing cards, titillating tiddlywinks, twisted twister, thumb wars, tickleathon

3. Lawn games – think badminton, croquet and lawn bowls…with a twist

4. School sports day – rounders, sack racing, three-legged races, egg-and-spoon races

5. Pub games – Totopoly, Great British pub quiz, binge-drink bingo, goggles darts, playing card darts, tongue darts (oh no! that’s something else entirely ;-) maybe a prize?)

If you go out in the woods today You're sure of a big surprise!</p>

The Caipirinha is the national beverage of Brazil and also an important element of the Brazilian Carnaval celebration—an important historical precedent to Burning Man.

Just look for the Brazilian Flag, the big cooler and the drunk people at Center Camp. Also, keep an eye out for a burly man in a Brazilian banana hammock.

If you want to help out, we're looking for people to bring the following:

Limes
Lime juice
Ice
Clear plastic/lexan glasses (any shape, bonus points for style)
Vodka
Cachaça
White sugar
Straws
Any large brazil paraphernalia

        </div>
        <p class="description">The Decentralized Dance Party is a portable, battery-powered Party system, with no Central audio source and no Central location.

It consists of hundreds of Party People, carrying vintage boomboxes, and a DJ who wears a backpack, containing a powerful FM transmitter.

All the boomboxes are tuned into the DJ’s master FM broadcast, resulting in a mobile, synchronized sound system. This Portable Dance Party roams the night, generating complete awesomeness, street by street and block by block, onto buses and subways, into public fountains and beyond. Inevitably interfacing with the public, together we create an infectious epidemic of fun. A Roaming Party Adventure that lasts all night long!

And the Decentralized Dance Party (DDP) is headed to Burning Man for the first time in 2012.

The plan is to throw a massive, Playa-wide DDP and create a Primeval Party Moment more powerful than all which have come before.

It’s likely to be a very good time.

THE PLAN:
Together, we will create a free-roaming, Open-Source-themed DDP, powered by over 150 synchronized boomboxes, guerrilla sound systems and art cars that will explore and interact with as many other art structures and theme camps as possible, in a full-throttle adventure that rages all over the Playa, from sunset to sunrise!

It will commence on Thursday August 30th, at 7:30, at the feet of the MAN, as the sun is setting and conclude twelve hours later, as the full moon Reaches Its Apex and the sun begins to rise on Friday morning...

Bring your own boombox, or borrow one from the 150 we will be lending out.

She has had a life-long love affair with music and dance - they are her spiritual practice and her most potent passions. ALIA transmits the bliss she experiences in performances to create a connected, alive and activated experience that evokes the sacred and awakens our connection to our source through rhythm and movement. She approaches every set as a ritual and as a facilitator of dance floor unity. ALIA has shared the stage with the likes of Beats Antique, Random Rab, Govinda, Freq Nasty, Marty Party, An-ten-nae, Heyoka, Pussymonster, Sasha Rose, Vibesquad, DJ Jocelyn, and Bay Area favorite DJ Dragonfly.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubastis
This is a Festival of the Feminine... the Sacred Feminine... the Dominant
Feminine.
The rules are simple:  Got a dick?  You're there to serve, obey, pamper, and amuse.
Women should dress their sexiest.
Men shall dress and be subservient, or be ejected and fed to feral cats!
Unichs will be on guard to ensure the rules are followed. (and yes... women can worship women too)</p>

        <p class="description">Young food activists are sparking a renaissance of a 150 year old order - The Grange.  A national organization having its roots in family farms and community halls. 

Many Granges have become home to food literacy and sovereignty activists and the slow foods movement.

While the Grange has its roots in a fraternal organization from the start it supported woman having an equal voice and vote.

The California State Grange is a leader in the Grange revitalization and was an early advocate of GMO labeling. 

California Prop 37 was initiated by a Granger.  California is one of many Granges throughout the country that are supporting a return of agriculture to local farming, organics, sustainable practices, alternative energy and localization of living and working.  We actively support the arts, music, education, youth and engage in a variety of community service projects.

California Grange is on the forefront of revitalizing this organization that was founded after the Civil War by family farmers who opposed domination by big banks and railroads that controlled markets and prices. 

Corporatocracy is ever more powerful and many Granges actively oppose it.

Come learn about the Grange and how we work to create relevant communities whether urban or rural rooted in family and friendship.</p>

We developed coping mechanisms to help us deal with these scary thoughts.  We fight for control of the universe. 

Women are terrified/traumatized and this is stressful.  We are overwhelmed and we are trained to think we aren't capable of fixing it ourselves.  We developed coping mechanisms to help us deal with these scary thoughts. We withdraw and don't try and wait for someone else to figure it out.  

The fact is we are all living based on a lie.  

Men, we can't fix it, we can't do it alone and our coping mechanisms aren't working.

Women, we are an essential part of the solution - no one can fix it for us or without us and our coping mechanisms aren't working.

This is the truth and it's beautiful in it's simplicity and elegant in solution.

We need each other.

So you see, the Truth is Beauty

So let's do it consciously, together.  

And let's start now at Burning Man...

For our daughters, our sons, ourselves we are inviting all of you, everyone, to a group hug:  11 pm at Truth is Beauty after the Core Burn. We hope to see you there.</p>

Our exhausted, dusty bodies were too tired to traipse across the across the playa to dance to our home-grown DJ, Dex Stakker.  Invite DJ to play, add tequila = Dex Mex!  Dex Mex (¡Olé!) has since grown to include world-class DJ talent and has been heralded by many as “the best daytime party on the playa”. Sure, that could have been the tequila talking, but tequila knows a good party, so you should listen when it speaks. So bring a cup, your tinfoil sombrero, and your anti-gravity dancing shoes and join the conga line from camp (8:45 & C) out to the party on the playa.</p>

        <p class="description">This is our 10th year!  

Each year since 2004, hundreds of naked burners meet at the Man to consume a little liquid courage, and pedal off into the City for a few hours of bar hopping.  Multiple host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the ride participants.  We’ll be stopping off at Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Duck Pond, and more.  If you make it to the end of the ride, the after party at Comfort & Joy will be hosted once again by a team of talented bartenders wearing nothing but their hospitality.  

This isn’t an event, it’s a tradition.  So if you’re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the goofiest parties on the playa.  Mugs for the first 400 riders (and yeah, we always run out).

Cheers!</p>

With guest DJs Lobsterdust, Entyme, Faroff, John!John!, Airsun, and more – along with mashup shows and performances throughout the night by  Alejandro and Adrian – Bootie BRC celebrates (and satirizes) pop culture both past and present, keeping your brain guessing and body dancing with creative song combinations. Mixing and matching every musical genre, era, and style into one big dance party, it's the soundtrack for the A.D.D. generation -- with free mashup CDs given away like candy! Launched in 2003 in San Francisco, Bootie was the first club night dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup, and is now the biggest mashup event in the world, with regular parties in several cities on four continents. Bootie BRC is presented in part by the BRC Weekly, Black Rock City's independent newsweekly. Bootie ... because one song at a time just isn't enough.</p>

Come Party in the SNOW storm! We have fake snow so wear your old-skool ski gear, toques,goggles, anything winter-sport related! That includes Luge lycra outfits! We will be serving up unique wintery themed drinks so make sure you saddle up to the bar with some friends and have a 5 person shot with the shot-ski! 5 shot glasses stuck to a ski which when tipped back always gets a little messy for the ill timed rookie!

And the main reason we put all this effort into doing this is to bring back the best music on the playa! The undisputed Queen of Après ski music, Foxy Moron willl once again be rounding up the most nuclear, the most funkulear, the most rump crunkulear DJ's on the playa! Can't tell you who till closer to the date!
Ski you August 28th on the playa! First person to show up wearing COLD WET acid wash jeans and an old Ocean Pacific or K-way jacket gets a mickey of Fireball!!</p>

As classes begin back home in San Francisco, we know there are many of us right here in Black Rock City. Instead of meeting in the halls to talk about how "great the burn was this year," and how “we should meet up next year,” let's get together on the Playa to celebrate our amazing community and the unique institution that we call home. PCC Professor Richard Tarnas will give an enlightening talk on the historical role of “heroic communities” in transforming the world (like CIIS and Burning Man). Wear your best Playa fashions, bring your friends and family, and maybe even get some ideas for your next academic paper. Let’s elevate “school spirit” to a new dimension while we enjoy each other outside of our default roles. We’ll have some drinks, we’ll have some laughs, and we’ll dance with reckless abandon as we get ready to transform the (default) world.

Wouldn't it be nice to be sure to catch at least ONE SUNRISE?
Wouldn't it be nice to share that with the people you know from the default world?
That's what WE THOUGHT!

An annual tradition, the last several years’ Wednesday morning PNW gatherings have been really great! An opportunity to see many people that you otherwise might not see at any other time during the week... Several people said they really appreciated the callout, as it ensured that they would catch at least ONE sunrise! And it's a sweet time to visit the Temple, mid-week, mid-progress with everyone adding their words & thoughts...

Meet you at the Temple, sunrise side, on Wednesday at 6am, & we'll watch the sun rise together.
Nice & simple, bring whatever you feel to share, or not!
Invite your friends, camp mates, associates... & we'll see you there.

Wed Sunrise at Temple of Whollyness, Black Rock City
Wed Aug 28, 6am meetup

You know who you are… maybe not Scottish by birth, but a single malt lover nonetheless.  Beautiful scotch, the more exotic and unique, the better.  If you understand – really understand – then this year at Burning Man, we may just have an event worth crossing the playa for.
Bring a bottle of your favorite drop to the Mystikal Misfits bar (4:30 & B) at 2 pm, Wednesday, August 28th.   Come armed with a strong thirst (if not an obsession) for rare single malts – the kind of bottlings that spark rave reviews and win awards.  Nothing blended, nothing commonplace.  Caress to impress with a spectacular scotch you’d like to turn the playa onto.  Once inside our exclusive event – NO BOTTLE, NO ENTRY – you will partake of Scottish music and nibbles with like-minded desert kiltsmen and women.
So while spewing feathers in the heat of the day, don’t be a numpty and end up blustered from just any bad swally and scran…  Settle into a little Misfit hospitality and savor the kind of “cargo” cults were actually started over…  You know at least one of the scotches will be spectacular, because you’re going to bring it.
And a dram good time will be had by all!

Entry requires a bottle of unique single malt scotch (no blends) , where you'll join other like-minded fans for a once-in-a-playa tasting they'll write bagpipe songs about.</p>

Start the week off feeling fabulous about yourself with a playlist that includes Queen Latifah, Li'l Kim, Salt-N-Pepa, DJ Kool, Notorious BIG, A Tribe Called Quest and much more! Come and shake what your mama gave you and don't feel bad about it for one second. These are your people, you big beautiful burner!
There will be an art video/photo project being created, for posting on the internet after the event, which shows all of the variety of bodies we radically accept on the playa, not just the models that can make the director's cut for the "Places you'll go" video. Come and get your body painted as our artist sees fit and take a step to show off your radical self love!
There will be Sonoma County Sangria served at the Thirsty Camel bar and a multi-media dance extravaganza inside the dome. Special long distance appearance by performance poet and founder of TBINAA, Sonya Renee, via recorded audio and video.</p>

        <p class="description">The Tetrion Spaceport

A very long time ago, Aliens came to this planet and built a spaceport. They brought in spaceships with supplies, did a little bit of genetic engineering and started what we know as modern civilization. Then they left without a trace. Without its force field, the spaceport reverted to basic elements. In other words, it dissolved.

The ancient people of that time did everything to try to call back the aliens and their spaceships. They built spaceports, called henges out of wood, to no avail. They even built a spaceport out of stone. Its remains can be found in Southern England and is known today as Stonehenge. Still no Aliens came. They were missing the technology they did not understand.

Well, we have figured it out. They were missing a beacon. Without a Quantum Transducer acting as a subspace beacon the alien spaceships have nothing to home in on. Well, we have fixed that. We built one. In fact, the entire spaceport is one giant beacon, shining like a lighthouse in the subspace frequencies.

At 11:00 p.m. on Wednesday night, we will turn on our subspace Quantum Transducer. A spaceship will appear and Johnfrum will return to Earth. He will bring us a message of peace and friendship. He will once again return to Earth and live with us in harmony.

We will welcome him with wine, women, music and dance. So be at Camp Tetrion and its Spaceport for the festivities. This will be the real deal! Rejoice! Johnfrum will come back at long last!</p>

So let’s bring them together and see what happens. Mormons, former Mormons, and anyone intrigued by Mormonism are all welcome to come chat about Joseph Smith, Native American-Hebrew ancestry, your favorite broadway musical from the creators of South Park, or any other Mormon related topics. We'll be stocked with sparkling cider for the true believers, and champagne and beer for the rest.</p>

Last year, we had a blast when a spontaneous chorus broke out in our camp, covering classic harmony-rich songs like Billy Joel's "For the Longest Time," and a tradition was born. We will gather and sing popular, well-known, or timeless songs in harmony (e.g., folk, pop, rock, opera, blues, barbershop, and on and on), without accompaniment (a capella). Song (lyric) sheets provided. All are welcome - no training needed.</p>

        <p class="description">Contradancing all levels every night to live music - looped/ traditional/ celtic/ fusion/ techno; fast-paced yet easy to learn with a caller who instructs (but with room for dancers to improvise). Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else - so it has a tribal vibe, where the Zen is flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition). The repeated cycles of movement give dancers a long time to catch on.  In any case if you are smiling you are doing it right.  Dancers adjust their behavior to each new dancer they come to and gently realign fellow dancers if needed making contradancing one of the most accessible group dance forms, with for example mentally disabled, blind, deaf and wheelchair bound dancers at many dances.  Friendly to children and adults carrying children.  Sunset - midnightish (later if everyone keeps going), except Sat starts 30 min after the man falls, Sun starts 60 min after the temple burn begins.  Go to website to 'taste' dancing (including headcam video) and music.</p>

His party side (the port or driver side) will contain a large sound system and a DJ platform, hidden by his fluffy exterior. His business side (the starboard or passenger side) houses generators, ventilation, passage between levels, and the exit.

Dress? Explorer. Native. Cult. 

Yes, the pith helmet looks good – it looks very good, as does your wild and bushy moustache, which cannot be tamed. For the women we imagine a hemp petticoat, 10-hole combat boots, and “Indra’s fishnet” stockings (tiny blinking jewel at each textile intersection). In these remixed times, all combination of personal decor will work. One thing, however, is required for all Explorers: a tool belt.

we know you got soul. How? It glints from behind your eyes, beams from your beautiful face, so save yourself.  Elevate. Celebrate so you can activate.

A: A scavenger hunt desert dance party! 




Wait... what is a scavenger hunt dance party you ask? It's real simple! At random points during the dance party we'll pick a category like snowboard goggles. You'll then have to find a burner walking around with snowboard goggles and bring them to the dance party to score points before we move onto the next category. If you get them to join your team, you'll score an additional point per round until they leave. There is even a rumor going around that there could be secret bonus rounds! Teams of any size welcome! Outpost 23 DJs will be throwing down 90s, one-hit wonders and mash up to celebrate the occasion.</p>

        <p class="description">Did you know that Black Rock City used to have a stop on the transcontinental railroad?  That an extensive subway system once rolled beneath the Playa?  That at one time you could ride a streetcar from Gate to the Temple?

None of that is true!  But at the Black Rock City Museum of Transportation History, we explore the fictional story of fictional transportation in a fictional historical Black Rock City.  Learn about how burners got around the Playa before bikes ruled and art cars amazed.  See pictures, models, and artifacts gathered since Black Rock City's fictional founding nearly 150 years ago.  Hear from a guide, or if we're not around, take a self-guided tour.  Perhaps most importantly, tell us your own stories, or perhaps your grandmother's, about BRC's fictional transportation past!

We'll be open during the day (lunchtime to dinnertime) starting on Monday.  Our big gala takes place on Wednesday night at 9pm--it's Burner black tie.  Come find us on 9:00 near Desiderata!  Hope to see you.</p>

        <p class="description">For those who may not know, Gabrielle Roth passed from this physical world last October 22. She created the 5 Rhythms Movement Meditation which is practiced the world over and her clear outline of access to our bodies and limitless expression through the dance has been an inspiration for much of the world's ecstatic dance community.

I am honored to honor her and invite her spirit to consecrate the space at RhythmWave Camp with her words, songs and guidance this one time.

We'll dance waves, because that's what we do. We'll move to some of Gabrielle's favorite songs, her guidance (it will be her voice you hear inter-spliced with the songs, offering guidance in the 5 Rhythms) and most of all we'll be together celebrating US as the way to honor HER, because that is what she would wish.

        <p class="description">This is our 11th year! Since 2004, hundreds of naked burners meet at the Man to consume a little liquid courage, and pedal off into the City for a few hours of bar hopping. Multiple host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the ride participants. We’ll be stopping off at Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Celestial Bodies, Duck Pond, and more. If you make it to the end of the ride, the after party at Comfort & Joy will be hosted once again by a team of talented bartenders wearing nothing but their hospitality. This isn’t an event, it’s a tradition. So if you’re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the goofiest parties on the playa. Mugs for the first 400 riders (and yeah, we always run out). Cheers!</p>

We all know that the Great Cthulhu is a colossal cephalopodic God that sleeps *almost* eternally in the Pacific Ocean. It’s gonna take a TREMENDOUS amount of noise and participation to wake him up! Do well to remember our chant "Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn," and feel free to bring your old alarm clocks, drums, pot n pans, virgin sacrifices, and other foul offerings that might entice the tuckered slimy one to stir from his slumber.

You must be 21 or over to Party here and we do ask for and check ID's (it's always good to carry your ID while at Burning Man). We start the mornings with Bloody Mary's at 9:00am until we run out. We then dispense our "Tiki Punch" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Party Naked Tiki Bar is the clothing optional bar that rewards your getting naked. This year we have 1500+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that "do it". Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.</p>

Meet the Artist, oil painter M Vlasic, get "shot", & see oil paintings of the citizens of Black Rock City (and other paintings by the artist). The artist will be taking more photographs of Burners at the opening, some of which may become oil paintings... Will YOU be the next subject? Wine served.


What is the Black Rock Portrait Project? It is a series of oil paintings of the “Children of the Dust”, the people of the Burning Man community. The people at the event are very unique, not just in their commonly outrageous dress (or undress) but their countenance, their demeanor, is unique to the event. Covered in dust these people have a spirit, a freedom unseen back in the “default” world. Because it is the people that create the event, it is my intention to focus on the individual. The “models” are photographed on-site, (with their written permission) and the paintings are created using these photographs  as a reference following the event. These paintings will eventually be shown in a gallery setting hopefully one which will travel the country. A book about the project is also in the works.</p>

100 bottles of single malt on the bar and you weren’t there!? Like a nightmare you can’t wake from. Except, you CAN... ‘Cause we’re doin’ it again! That’s right, Scotchfest is back -- your basic confluence of peat, dust, and obsessed freaks like you!

The rules are simpler than golf, so pay attention...

Bring a bottle of your favorite drop to the Mystikal Misfits bar (4:30 & C) at 2 pm, Wednesday, August 27th.

MALT FESTIVAL, jocko – exotic, unique, transcendent -- and we’re looking to learn what YOU like. In return, every other souser presents a bottle of their best game, so make no other plans until 6 pm. 

Be prepared for Scottish music, savory nibbles, and a superlative group of like-minded Burner scotch freaks! They don’t do this kind of thing where you live, boyo, so mark it down.

And remember, it’s an exclusive event -- NO BOTTLE, NO ENTRY.

So, if you’re tromping through the desert stour spewing feathers like a twally, know that Lassie or Laddie, skuddy roaster or minted dobber, we’ll be gettin’ belter blootered at the Misfits, mate... If you ain’t geein it yaldy, hell slap it intae ye!

And as we’re fond of saying, “A dram good time will be had by all!”</p>

        </div>
        <p class="description">Vines Without Borders (Vines) is a global wine bar and lounge inviting guests and wines from around the world to convene for an unforgettable burn. Whether you’re an enophile (lover of wine) or a neophile (lover of new things) Vines is the first ‘port of call’ on your Caravansary journey. Our inviting venue features a lively lounge furnished with vintage couches and chairs, illuminated with LED lighting, showcasing a sleek LED back-lit bar designed and built especially for this burn. The Vines international wine theme is our unifying principle for global community and festivity. We will craft an intimate, interactive experience that provides opportunity for people from everywhere to drop in and enjoy discovering others on a deeper level, making connections that survive beyond the week. Our desire to connect stems from experience with our previous Camp Dawdle where we offered adventure rides on the Wheel of Passage. Guests loved the randomness and fun of the wheel rides, gave many thank-you hugs, but quickly moseyed on their merry way. It was unfortunately a fleeting interaction model. We felt we met many great souls but didn’t get to know any of them. With our new Vines concept, we increase our ‘stickyness’ with a cool wine lounge and an emphasis on international guests. Our wine focus and casual setting invites conversation while unavoidable language barriers ensure focused interaction, commitment to the moment and ultimately greater intimacy. Vines will bring together burners from around the world to make global connections around a unifying theme of wine.  In the spirit of Caravansary we will be a multicultural hub of interaction and wine sharing. We’ll enjoy the melody of world languages spoken throughout our camp and across our bar. Of course, we’ll also howl at our own grammatical gaffes while we resort to hand waving to articulate our most earnest points. What we’ll enjoy most will surely be the communion of the raised wine glass as we toast one another.</p>

Après ski Black Rock City is back for 2014!

Same Wednesday night and same area as years past. 3 ish and G-spot zone!

Come down(wink wink) off the slopes and Party with us in true Après ski style! We have snow so wear your old-skool ski gear, toques, goggles, anything winter-sport related!

We will be serving up lots of Fireball and White wine sangria so make sure you saddle up to the bar with some friends and have a 4 person shot with the shot-ski! 4 shot glasses stuck to a ski which when tipped back always gets a little messy for the ill timed rookie! And for those burly types we will have 2 person mug-a-chugs! A beer mug on each end of a snowboard full of beer. If you're afraid of commitment then mug-a-chugs aren't for you!

And the main reason we put all this effort into doing this is to bring back the best music on the playa! The undisputed Queen of Après ski music, Foxy Moron willl once again be rounding up the funkiest DJs on the playa! Can't tell you who till closer to the date!

Ski you August 27th on the playa!</p>

We've scheduled this for two hours, but we reserve the right to keep at it if we (or, more importantly, you) are having a great time.

Anita's Dropship is a mobile sound system playing generative dubstep that produces drops on demand by user input. 

We want you out here with us. 

For this brief party we will be celebrating all the incredible contributors of the project, along with everyone else nearby. We will captivate you with music, you will dance, you will be happy, and when you feel like you want to crank up the beat, that is what you will do. With two cranks on Anita's Dropship, you can fan the flame of the musical crescendo until you ultimately climax with a glowing red button. With one punch, you summon THE DROP which will bring all those within earshot to their knees.

Please join us at sundown, Wednesday 8/27, on the playa, across the esplanade from The Institute.</p>

So we here at Camp Dusty Justice are celebrating that practice and bringing an open, slightly impartial, fun venue for Burners of all stripes to get their dusty dirty day in court.  Our camp will feature a sultry judge (with a real law degree!) known for her fairly fair and reasonably reasonable decisions.  If you are convicted or found liable, you can accept her sentence, which is guaranteed to be interesting or you can try your luck at the wheel of punishment.  Or you may win your case and see your opponent subjected to Playa justice.  Either way, someone always pays!  Whatever the choice or the outcome, you can be assured of an unbalanced hearing…for the Playa, that is.
 
Bring your case!  You will be heard!  Is it your noisy neighbor?  A spat with a girlfriend?  Did a campmate drink your last cold beer?  Maybe it was just your turn to drive the art car.  Whatever the dispute, our jurist will sort it out.

We will hold court twice during the week or if an emergency arises.  Join us Wednesday afternoon and Friday afternoon from 3-5 for fun, laughs, and some serious judgments and some wicked punishments.</p>

        <p class="description">Salon 7 - 8:15 & B
Join us on your caravan’s pilgrimage through the playa for inspiring and amusing journeys into tequila, beats, dancing and yoga……
 
A salon is a gathering of people under the roof of an inspiring host, held partly to amuse one another and partly to refine the taste and increase the knowledge of the participants through conversation either to please or to educate.
 
Each of our events holds this definition in heart, whether through poetic infusions of daily yoga, techno and tequila at twilight or the pleasure of afternoon bubbles and beats.

• Twilight Tequila Tuesday - 8pm-midnight
• Twilight Tequila, Thursday – 6pm – 2am
• Bubbles and Beats, Saturday 2pm – 10pm
• Daily yoga Jam Tuesday to Saturday 11am-1pm</p>

We’re on a soul-shaking mission to turn clubbing upside down and transform mornings into something truly remarkable, and you’re invited!

Dancing is the ultimate exercise and we humans have been doing it for thousands of years long before treadmills and yoga mats were invented! Free improvised dancing in space (no routines here) uniquely wakes up your body, mind and creativity and will leave you feeling more energized and alive than you could ever imagine. 

This is a morning movement popping up in cities across the world; invigorating the Wednesday mornings of Tokyo,  Barcelona, Sidney, New York, San Francisco, London, Bangalore, Melbourne, Brighton, Amsterdam, Dublin, Zurich, and now, Black Rock City!

What to Expect: A yoga space, massage, coconut water, and a high energy dance party to get your day started in the best possible way.  

Our Morning Gloryville San Francisco resident DJ, Rachel Torro will be shakin it behind the decks all morning!

We can't wait to boogie with you in the dust :)

Cue the music montage as the Unimog rolls from village to camp to backwaters junkyard to recruit the heavyweights of Playa legend for yet another run for the ages. This fleet will be more rag tag than Battlestar Gallactica’s; it will throw down more funky radio waves than Convoy; it will bodily propel you through the deep playa night and on through till morning leaving you lost and found and lying on the ground.

Ya, we’re getting the band back together, so soundcars assemble! We need you small and big, shiny, loud, fiery, and funky and our own Tamo (tamo@tamodesign.com) will help you circle your wagon with ours.

MV Confirmed:
-The Unimog

        <p class="description">Did you know that Black Rock City used to have a stop on the transcontinental railroad? That an extensive subway system once rolled beneath the Playa? That at one time you could ride a streetcar from Gate to the Temple?

None of that is true! But at the Black Rock City Museum of Transportation History, we explore the fictional story of fictional transportation in a fictional historical Black Rock City. Learn about how burners got around the Playa before bikes ruled and art cars amazed. See pictures, models, and artifacts gathered since Black Rock City's fictional founding nearly 150 years ago. Hear from a guide, or if we're not around, take a self-guided tour. Perhaps most importantly, tell us your own stories, or perhaps your grandmother's, about BRC's fictional transportation past!

We'll be open during the day (lunchtime to dinnertime) starting on Monday.

Our Burner "Black Tie" Gala takes place on Wednesday night at 9PM. Fancy wine, cheese, and more! Come find us on 9:00 near Isfahan behind the museum.</p>

Multiple host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the riders. This year’s host camps will be Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Duckpond, Cubhouse, Gaylactic Village, and Celestial Bodies, culminating in a legendary afterparty at Comfort & Joy hosted by a team of talented bartenders wearing nothing but hospitality. If you’re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the goofiest parties on the playa. We aren’t making a statement or pushing an agenda; we’re just riding our bikes, drinking some cocktails, and making new friends.  Oh yeah, and we’re naked.  Mugs for the first 500 riders (and yeah, we always run out). Cheers!</p>

Music will consist of a variety of things that are not EDM, such as classic and alternative rock. Beer Pong is a possibility if our moop management plans pan out. Food will include your backyard staples- hotdogs, lamb skewers, corn on the cob, and various other items.

The bar will, of course, be open. We plan to have a keg to serve inexpensive beer (and also cut down on MOOP from cans.)

Games Include:

Cornhole/Bag Toss
Ladder Golf
Horseshoes
Darts

If you are smiling, you are doing it right.  Kid friendly.  Possible for many disabled. No need to bring a partner.  Everyone who shows up should have a good time.</p>

Then join us at Camp Beaverton in our Beaver Dome for this workshop. We will open with heartfelt sharing about our relationships with masturbation, address the stigmas faced in society, and open ourselves to understanding why and how we pleasure ourselves. Once we are all comfortable, we will start exploring our bodies. We will keep our hands to ourselves and power up our bullets, magic wands, rabbits, or other fun battery-operated toys. We will not be able to provide much AC power for the Hitachis so if you have an extra generator, please bring it to help charge up those in need! Safer sex supplies like lube, gloves, hand sanitizer, and condoms will be available. Cum take a ride with us! Women/Trans identified only please.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="description">Last Bar on Earth or First bar on Play, depending on which way you reach the trash fence. Located along the fence, like a mirage looming in the distance, out of the desert, from the dust: Ice Cold Margaritas. The Last Bar on Earth, past the Esplanade, past the Man, past the Temple… as far as a person can go in Black Rock City.
…or…
The First Bar on the Playa; depending on which way you are coming to the bar. For those trekking across the barren wasteland, evading the dozen or so security and law enforcement agencies, avoiding detection by radar and heat sensors, struggling to finally reach the perimeter fence; our Bar is there to offer you an ice cold beverage and welcome you Home with a hug, brother/sister, before contacting the proper authorities and turning you over to security.

For several years I have rode my bicycle with trailer out to the furthest point in Black Rock City with all the booze, juice, water, soda and ice I could fit in the 3 large ice-chests. I purposely set up at the remotest spot I can find, away from camps, sound systems, art vehicles and crowds.  Trying to provide a service to intrepid playa explorers, people out riding bikes along the trash fence, those reaching beyond the EDM to see the desert vastness. As they spot our stack of coolers along the fence, in they trickle and find Iced Cold Margaritas waiting for them. Every year we go through every drop of beverage we can carry out there, usually in under an hour or two. Hosted by Camp Threat.

Bring a cup and witty banter. Join us at the fence.

And, YES, most definitely, Daft Punk will be playing.</p>

        <p class="description">My camp, the Free Photography Zone, has been doing portraits of the participants of Burning Man continuously for the past 19 years.  Each person, or group, is photographed in a studio setting and given an instant print as their tangible reminder of their Burning Man experience.  I then photograph then on medium format black and white film so that, if they wish, they can get prints at a later date.

These are not a re-do of your high school yearbook portrait just in Burning Man attire.  I try to give each person enough time to help me make a lasting photograph.  On our gallery walls in our shade structure there are black and white prints ranging in size from 16x20" to 4x5' that I hope will be of some inspiration to you.  Though I try not to duplicate what I have done in the past they may serve as a jumping off point for our photography session.  Not the easiest thing given the approximately 47,000 black and white negatives done so far.  I have never counted and see no reason to start now.

I consider the people I photograph as the most important part of any photograph and always try my best to make a photograph that will be of lasting value and interest well beyond the moment of its creation.

Come, join me, and together we may make something wonderful.  

I usually begin each day about 10 or 11 AM and continue into the night till I can't keep on my feet any longer.  Weather permitting I'll begin on Sunday August 30th through Saturday September 5th.

I do look forward to photographing you.</p>

        <p class="description">Welcome to Swap Meat!

This event is organized by The Trustable Sluts: a community of sexually liberated socially responsible women.

This is a mixer for sexually liberated, socially responsible women* and the men and women (and everyone in between) who love them.

With Swap Meat, we turn traditional gender dynamics on their head and invite both men and women who want to date, relate and have sexual connections with women who identify as women* who are self-aware, sex-positive, love warriors.

WHO ARE WE: trustablesluts.com

There will be little structure and much fun. We will bring something to identify the "meat" and identify Trustable Slut Members.

# 1 rule of SWAP Meat is
you bring someone AWESOME
to SWAP Meat.

We want to be introduced to more amazing people who want to meet fun, playful, and open women, who are in alignment with our values.

Bring someone who you would recommend to date your best friend. Bring someone who is "available" to date. Bring someone who has good boundaries and knows how to communicate. Bring someone who YOU are 100% okay with sharing.

Who NOT to bring:
-Some random person off the playa
-Someone who is overly eager to hook-up (aka desperate).
-Someone who isn't emotionally available or at least self-aware.

Official Meat Policy:

1) Meat can be of any gender.
2) We encourage "available" meat. That word has many interpretations...it is whatever it means to you. However, here are some ways it means to us:
+ is single or in an open relationship.
+ their relationship agreements allow for dating.
+ has time to date, meaning not just interested in hooking-up.
+ has experience in our or some other community of sexy tribe.
+ has emotional intelligence and communication skills.

*NOTE: We are open to all gender orientations and sexual orientations. We are LGBTQ friendly.</p>

This is a party celebrating redheads, "the Ginger", "the firecrotch" and those bespeckled with freckles in all their glory!  Redheads are less than 3% of the global population. Here, they become the 99%. Bigger, better and redder than last year, still serving “redheaded sluts".

        <p class="description">It has happened to us all.  You're having a great time, easy and happy, dancing through the weeds of your own small life, and suddenly -- a clown.  He's trying to be funny at you.  He's a burlesque.  Or a Bozo.  Or a body comedian.  You can't punch him because that would be wrong.  You can't cry because you're terrified.  And you can't laugh because the life has been sucked out of you.  So you push it down, deep inside.  Where the clown trauma festers in its own silent and pressurized tank of suppressed rage and fear.

These incidents have been seen with increasing frequency as clowning has infiltrated our community.  Clowns are easy.  Clowns are anonymous.  Clowns are everywhere.  And clowns are dangerous.  They are the death knell of participation culture, just as the deadbeats were the death knell of hippie culture.  They embody the cheap, the quick, and the easy, and they should not be allowed to take over.

Come to our shaded bar and snack on our snacks with us.  Learn the story of clowns, past, present, and future.  Drink your health in a clown-free zone.  Crush the red nose of clown oppression.  And embed a new mantra into your soul: 

I will never be clowned again.</p>

Bootie BRC celebrates (and satirizes) pop culture both past and present, keeping your brain guessing and body dancing with creative song combinations. Mixing and matching every musical genre, era, and style into one big dance party, it's the soundtrack for the A.D.D. generation -- with free mashup CDs given away like candy!

Launched by DJ duo A Plus D in 2003 in San Francisco, Bootie was the first club night dedicated solely to the burgeoning artform of the bootleg mashup, and is now the biggest mashup event in the world, with regular parties in several cities on four continents. Bootie BRC is presented in part by the BRC Weekly, Black Rock City's independent newsweekly.

LL Cool J, said it best….. 

“I want a girl with extensions in her hair, Bamboo earrings, at least two pair.
A Fendi bag and a bad attitude, that's all I need to get me in a good mood
She can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
I love it when a woman ain't scared to do her thang
Standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
Once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop.”

And to that Salt and Pepa would say..… 

“If looks could kill you would be an uzi
You're a shotgun - bang! What's up with that thang?
I wanna know how does it hang?
Straight up, wait up, hold up, Mr. Lover
Like Prince said you're a sexy mutha-…

….I love you in your big jeans, you give me nice dreams
You make me wanna scream, "Oooo, oooo, oooo!"
I like what ya do when you do what ya do…You make me wanna shoop”

Drops the mic….

It is an undeniable fact: there are more sombreros than Mexicans on Playa! As a Mexican I just get giddy happy when I see my fellow Burners with colorful sombreros throughout Playa.... it simply evokes the festive nature of my culture: fiesta, spirits, baile, canto and some good food! I want to take it a step further and challenge 'cultural appropriation' stigmas out there by making it a WIN-WIN situation here: If you wear a Sombrero on Playa, you gotta KiSS A MEXiCAN! Come celebrate in the BiGGEST GATHERiNG OF BURNERS with SOMBREROS at Center Camp Cafe. Bring your SOMBREROS, your TEQUILA, and your AMiGOS... and together we'll go in search of MEXiCANS ON PLAYA and share the LOVE!!!

This year I am also gonna do something that IT'S SO OUT OF MY LEAGUE and make a ViDEO!!! SO come be part of the GIFT the GiVES and immortalize yourselves (and your SOMBRERO) in a funky video I got prepared for ya!! Arriba Arriba!!</p>

        <p class="description">On Tuesday the Queen Dick pub's Village Green will be the scene of a genteel tea party.  This is a quintessential British daytime party with outrageous games that will start on the Village Green and flow into the evening:
Knights on Bikes: 'Lance-A-Lot' - Amateur jousting,
Human fruit machine,
Blindfolded-roly-poly-cuppa-tea-relay,
Lemon and spoon battle,
Morris prancing,
Human snake,
Robbie Burns' Remix Reeling,
Alongside these lovely games we will also have some S&M thrown in for some naughty measure. Beneath the thin veneer of respectability, all is never what it seems; we’ll offer soft (and comfortable) slipper spankings, corduroy chaps and lavender scented latex. 
And of course all day banging party music that'll pushes the party up to an 11!  And don't forget, the Queen Dick will have cold beer on tap all day to refresh you throughout the day.
Come join us!!</p>

Come gather together and celebrate the true atmosphere of the desert. Celebrate the creativity born from the dust. Celebrate with music inspired by the playa that you can really (((feel))) 

Rather than recreating a default world 'nightclub', we summon a unique desert experience to stimulate the less mainstream dwellers of the dust )?( 

All Day / All Night - from TUES to BURN NIGHT (*with a special Surprise Party for Mama-M. on Burn Night) Come help us 'Surprise' her! 

Check at the camp on-playa for the most updated lineup of artists. *Also the Camp? website & alternate BM lineup outlets. 
Basically we like interesting beat patterned, well represented low end bass music. To accent & enhance the experience of celebrating together out in the desert.

Venture back in time to the early 1900’s and get a peak into how prostitutes lived in the red light district of New Orleans. We’ll showcase real “ladies of the night” by having framed pictures of women hung throughout the bar. We’ll ask insightful questions of our guests in hopes to get them thinking about the lives and personalities that inspired our beloved camp theme. Also, we value Radical Inclusion and it is our hope to build a cohesive and connected neighborhood. In an attempt to establish community, we’ll promote our first happy hour as a “get to know your neighbors” event. Throughout the day, SLS members will venture out into the community, greet the neighbors and request their presence and attendance at our first event.</p>

Sometimes drinks are gifted, sometimes they are bartered; but never sold!!! So leave your $$ in your tent, and bring something fun to tip your bartender!!!   We do not operate on any schedule, so the rule of thumb is: If the barstools are down, we are most likely serving drinks, or at least attitude...

        <p class="description">The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. 

Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject.

We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa.

The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999. The pinhole came about of the desire of four first time participants to contribute in a unique and lasting way to the ephemeral pleasures of the playa.

As we have grown, so too has our belief that this device is the reason that we make our annual pilgrimage. As we have evolved, so too has the camera, not only in functional and technical capabilities but also in its role as a seed of meaningful engagement with other participants.</p>

It started with a vision. A vision of Germans in a slightly alternate dimension. A dimension where the only way to dance to German techno was under the strict supervision of a leader. The leader would announce "And now we dance!" and they dance dance dance, only to be followed by "And now we fight!" whereupon a raging fist fight would break out. Soon enough, the leader barks "And now we dance!", fists are dropped, and they stomp dance once more. 

It was a very silly vision. And now we bring this vision to you. Join us and alternate between internal states of joy and (joyful) rage as rapidly as we alternate between dancing and (pillow) fighting. Pillows provided.</p>

To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality. In this sense, naturism, as the cultural and political movement of nudism is often known, is an inherently philosophical practice. 

And what better way to do philosophy than naked? We’re sure your college seminars would have been much more fun nude.

Come and join us for lively discussions, debates and story-telling. We’ll be discussing naturism, body image, sharing experiences, debating body modification, if and how laws should be changed – really everything related to the human body.</p>

        <p class="description">False Profit, Inc., sent shock waves through the stock market with its recent announcement of current plans for its annual Tuesday Night Party (TNP) at The Burning Man Arts and Culture Festival. In a move outside experts are hailing for its boldness and freshtasticness, False Profit, Inc., released news that it would be holding the event not at its desert research field campus proper, but “out in the open.”

“For 14 years, we’ve invited shareholders to our desert campus to celebrate with us,” said Jef Pearlman, Senior VP of Auditory Logistics. “This year, we decided to think ‘outside the camp.’”

Citing ever-increasing attendance, bicycle parking challenges, and the desire for attendees to experience high fidelity sound “en plein air” as forces pushing the party into the open playa, , a spokesperson for the company enthusiastically predicted that this year’s TNP would be “the best evar.”

Referring to the unanticipated relocation, an unnamed insider also hinted that the main research facility is so filled this year with mad science projects--which shareholders will undoubtedly wish to keep a watchful eye on as conditions evolve--that the decision to shift was “easy peasy”.

The party will be held on the open “playa” approximately 300 feet out from the company’s primary campus location of 5:15 and Esplanade. This location was chosen due to the giant deep sea fish that will be located there, which analysts expect will protect attendees from wandering shirtcockers, newbs, darkwads, those rich people who are destroying Burning Man, and other unsavory characters. Known as Illumacanth, the fish will delight and astound party attendees with its spikes, lights, and fire. Sound for the event will be provided by the legendary Dr. Brainlove, a project of The Phage, a long-time affiliate company and co-conspirator of False Profit.</p>

Whether you’re one of us or just enjoy our silly accents come and enjoy some fair dinkum Australian culture, dinky-di beer and ridgy-didge food on us. Play some Goon of Fortune, give cricket a burl, hug a koala or belt out some Aussie pub anthems. This is the official meet up for Aussies on the playa but we also really want to share our culture with our American (and other) friends so everyone is welcome! You’d have to be mad as a cut snake to miss it!

If you’re an Aussie headed over for the burn and you’d like to help out by smuggling in some Cherry Ripes, Fantales or even maybe a bottle of Bundy track us down on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/groups/BurningManAussies2016/) and give us a shout.</p>

Our Bartenders are on Vacay too so they can be nice or they can be snarky! Sometimes drinks are gifted, sometimes they are bartered; but never sold!!! So leave your $$ in your camp, and bring something fun to tip your bartender!!! Please bring a cup that you can pimp out while you wait. We do not operate on any schedule, so the rule of thumb is: If the barstools are down, we are most likely serving drinks, or at least attitude... Some of our games include: Pool, fooseball, tether ball, shuffleboard, white trash horseshoes, and we are excited to introduce nascar inspired drag racing!</p>

Half the moves are with your partner, half with everyone else, resulting in a tribal vibe, where the Zen is flow, synchrony, and bonding (not footwork, not competition). If you are smiling, you are doing it right. Kid friendly. Possible for many disabled. No need to bring your own partner. Everyone who shows up should have a good time</p>

Multiple host camps will have bartenders standing by with icy libations prepared exclusively for the riders. Among this year’s host camps are Barbie Death Camp & Wine Bistro, Duckpond, Cubhouse, BAAAHS, and Celestial Bodies. The ride culminates with an 80s Jazzercise Dayglo afterparty hosted by the wonderful folks at Comfort & Joy. If you’re willing to meet the dress code, join us for one of the goofiest parties on the playa. No statement or political agenda; just riding our bikes, drinking some cocktails, and making new friends. Oh yeah, and we’re naked. Mugs for the first 500 riders (and yeah, we always run out).

Except, you CAN... ‘Cause we’re doin’ it again! That’s right, Scotchfest is back -- your basic confluence of peat, dust, and obsessed freaks like you! The rules are simpler than golf, so pay attention... Bring a bottle of your favorite drop to the Mystikal Misfits bar (4:30 & B) at 2 pm, Wednesday, August 31st. MALT FESTIVAL, jocko – exotic, unique, transcendent -- and we’re looking to learn what YOU like. In return, every other souser presents a bottle of their best game, so make no other plans until 6 pm. Be prepared for Scottish music, savory nibbles, and a superlative group of like-minded Burner scotch freaks! They don’t do this kind of thing where you live, boyo, so mark it down. And remember, it’s an exclusive event -- NO BOTTLE, NO ENTRY. So, if you’re tromping through the desert stour spewing feathers like a twally, know that Lassie or Laddie, skuddy roaster or minted dobber, we’ll be gettin’ belter blootered at the Misfits, mate... If you ain’t geein it yaldy, hell slap it intae ye! And as we’re fond of saying, “A dram good time will be had by all!”</p>

All are invited to the Grand Opening of the Guild Workshops in the piazza at the Man Base! Join us as we celebrate the confluence of artists, makers, tinkerers, and craftspeople from across the world! Among these modern day maker spaces conceived in the spirit of the Renaissance you’ll find glassblowers, blacksmiths, dreamers, chainsaw-wielding portrait makers, musicians and engineers all beckoning your hands on participation in their craft!

The festivities will kick off with a costumed masquerade procession starting at 5:45pm at the Everywhere/Artery Pavilion (6:15 and Esplanade) and leading into the Guild Workshops at the Man Base, where our Guild Workshops Celebration will begin at 6:30 pm. Please don your Renaissance-inspired finery or just come as your creative self!

Combining the fun game of Hop Scotch with one of the most wonderful beverages to grace the planet, Scotch makes for an entertaining and social area where people from all areas, and even all ages (with Children, being the under-21 crowd,) creating a silly and fun set of events bringing out the child in all of us. The social events for Scotch & Hop take different types and games of Hop Scotch from all over the world, and have people jump around and play various forms of the game. Once a Black Rock citizen, who is over 21, has completed a game, they are invited in for a Scotch or Scotch cocktail. (And usually we include other adult-beverages.) Getting young and old, from all across the planet, together and playing Hop Scotch makes people remember the silliness of when they were kids. Also being able to have children be able to play along in the games opens up the experience to everyone.</p>

The lecture while initially quiet and seemingly undersubscribed, ballooned at the end, and become a smash hit. The White Trash came out to learn about their interesting "habits," and demonstrated how to make everything a little bit more glamorous and trashy. This year, we're going to be doing the same with the Super-Duper Photo Essay. Lectures and bedazzling are just the start as a review on White Trash participation in Black Rock City.</p>

It’s exhausting, but worth it, and you made it.  Go You!  Now it’s time to celebrate!  

Movement of Jah People and Camp Walter have teamed up to combine two amazing parties into one; The Welcome Homebrew Happy Hour and The 4:20 Reggae Party!!!  Come join us at Camp Walter (10 and Esplanade) between 3-6pm on Monday of burn week.  We'll be serving up some ice cold home brews, while you're getting down to funky reggae jams.  

We look forward to catching up old friends and getting to know the new, see you soon!

Also, if you’re an avid home brewer and wish to share your creation(s), message us.</p>

Thursday night, Suzanne Swan and her friends will gather to observe their most sacred ritual -- the Swan Lake Ball. Guests are encouraged to don their finest playa formal and liberate their inner swan (or other spirit animal) as we come together to celebrate, dance and reenact the ancient history of the swamp. All guests are encouraged to take on a role in order to ensure that we experience this reemergence on the playa again -- come on!</p>

Our specialty is morning Cocktails (think mimosas and palomas). We also have coffee for those not wanting to travel all the way to Center Camp and stand in the long lines. Besides our tasty beverages, we offer a welcoming atmosphere, comfortable seating, games, friendly conversations, and journals that we encourage guest to write (or draw) their TALES from the playa in. Each year the journals will make the annual journey home so they can added to and enjoyed again and again...
We open when the sun comes up (or whenever we feel like it), and stay serving most of the day (or until we are sick of it), always providing a place for weary burners to rest throughout the day and then kicking up the party at night.</p>

Join us for one of the best "rockumentaries" (dumb word) of all time:  "David Byrne walks onto the stage and does a solo "Psycho Killer." Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz join him for two more songs. The crew is busy, still setting up. Then, three more musicians and two back-up singers join the band. Everybody sings, plays, harmonizes, dances, and runs. They change instruments and clothes. Bryne appears in the Big Suit. The backdrop is often black, but sometimes it displays words, images, or children's drawings. The band cooks for 18 songs, the lyrics are clear, the house rocks. In this concert film, the Talking Heads hardly talk, don't stop, and always make sense." (thanks IMDB!)</p>

Once we are all comfortable, we will start exploring our bodies. We will keep our hands to ourselves and power up our bullets, magic wands, rabbits, or other fun battery-operated toys. After about 20 minutes the party will open to play with others. Safer sex supplies like lube, gloves, hand sanitizer, and condoms will be available. Cum take a ride with us!

Wear your grooviest duds that show off your spirit of the 60’s and take a trip in our Yellow Submarine as we gaze upon The Beatles 1968 voyage through Pepperland! Enjoy refreshments while you watch the movie with fellow fans! Harmonize with The Beatles during the movie and attend our after party in our Karaoke sing-a-long!   Come for the movie; stay for the vocal jam. - Some years ago on the Playa, we had a total blast when a spontaneous chorus broke out in our camp, covering classic songs, and an annual tradition was born. We’re updating that tradition as we gather this year to sing timeless Beatles tunes with/without accompaniment. Everyone’s invited and welcomed! It ain’t over ’til it’s over!</p>

We'll begin the day by watching:
- 9:00 Hawaii at Michigan...wear your colors & Go Blue!
- 9:00 Oklahoma at Houston
[If the Michigan game is a blowout, then we may be able to show some of the Rutgers at Washington game at 11:00 am...we will at least show the 2nd half.]

At mid-day, the focus shifts to:
- 12:30 UCLA at Texas A & M
- 12:30 LSU at Wisconsin

Mid-afternoon, we'll show:
- 2:30 North Carolina at Georgia

The big late game will be:
- 5:00 USC vs Alabama
This game will end around 8:30 - 8:45...the Man Burn takes place at 9:30, so come prepared and be ready to bolt at the end of the game.

Bonus coverage:
- 6:00 Clemson at Auburn
This game will end as the Man Burn is underway...if you find a responsible fan, you may watch and shut down the Cafe.


Crazy, nutty bonus coverage on Sunday...hey, I don't make the schedule...we can only pray for a favorable outcome before the Temple Burn ;-)
- 4:30 Notre Dame at Texas

If you have a request for a particular college game, the management of the Harmonic Cafe will try to accommodate :-)</p>

We'll offer you champagne to relax and a comfy chill space to enjoy the sounds while resting your feet.

Before entering the event, our Test Subjects must pass through the dome where they will be given the option to be converted into either a robot or an alien form.

Our Scientists will then equip the guests with their choice of robot arm tubes, alien deeliboppers, green or silver facepaint, etc. Inside they can trade parts, commiserate with their fellow aliens or robots, and/or decide the future of intelligent life in this galaxy as it pertains to the outcome of the great Robot-Alien War.... as they ponder the galactic beats.</p>

Its our way of connecting to others.  It can be cathartic and source of joy. We're as serious as we can be about something that makes us positively silly; dance and play is our form of worship. To that end, when we dance, we really mean it. Our Wednesday Night Worship is our annual on Playa dance party that brings friends new and old from across the Playa to 'worship' with us in the Dance Church.</p>

        <p class="description">Nudity has the power to surprise and shock, yet why, on reflection, can something as mundane as the naked body inspire simultaneously so much passion and revulsion? To be naked in 21st century western society demands intense self-examination, the questioning and reappraisal of conventional conventions and morality. In this sense, naturism, as the cultural and political movement of nudism is often known, is an inherently philosophical practice. And what better way to do philosophy than naked? We’re sure your college seminars would have been much more fun nude. Come and join us for lively discussions, debates and story-telling. We’ll be discussing naturism, body image, sharing experiences, debating body modification, if and how laws should be changed – really everything related to the human body.</p>

As your families invited your communities over, as the generations of soul families invited their communities over, so too does the Heroes & Super Villains family invite the Playa community over to eat together, drink together, get to know one another, dance with each other and uplift each other. From noon until sunset, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.

We also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptised anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.

On it's 11th Annual Celebration of the Soul Brunch, we were gifted curated sounds from Marques Wyatt, Paul Geddes, Deep Wood, Rafael de la Cruz, David Kiss, Big Daddy & more!

        <p class="description">Come enjoy craft cocktails made by a former Florentine bartender. Bring your flight- or travel-related kitsch, or show us your landing strip, or both! Our steamy-eyed bartender will ask you three either-or questions that reveal your true self, then serve you one of 8 top-shelf cocktails accordingly. You may overrule, but there will be consequences, such as body shots. Share your hilarious or hair-raising stories of international travel. We've been there and back again, have a billion of 'em. Introduce yourself to the Captain and you might get to see the cockpit! The party starts at sunset (around 7:40) and we'll be open at least an hour and a half. Find us on Italic between 4 and 4:30. In case we have to camp a block away, look for a sign with reflective tape indicating the vector for final approach. BYOC. See you there!</p>
