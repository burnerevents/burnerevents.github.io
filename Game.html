        <p class="description">The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak.

Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior. How could we not bring this back for 2010?</p>

beards to the House of Automatic Subconscious, where we shall take 
the time to parade you before us like so much hairy meat and pass 
judgment upon those locks and curls that cascade off of the area 
known as your chinny-chin-chin. There will be 4 prime categories: 
Full-Beard, Moustache, Freestyle Full Beard, Fake Beard and quite 
probably not possibly, an "Other" category.

As per usual in this sort of event, our highly esteemed panel of 
untrained professionals will judge upon such features as glossiness 
of pelt, lack of nits, creativity, fullness of body, amount of previous 
dinner ensconced within and other equally tangible parameters that attest 
to the care and feeding of your personal face troll. Bribery and 
foolishness are considered de rigueur.

All that is necessary is that you have some form of facial hair, a 
good and jolly spirit, and the necessary accoutrement of a cummerbund. 
One must have the proper air of formality around such an event as this, 
do not you agree?</p>

        <p class="description">Solve Puzzles and Puns in our PLAYPEN - When 2 players find pieces of a puzzle and touch each other, then buzzers buzz, lights light & prizes are won.

The playpen measures 8 feet by 12 feet but only 2 feet high, which means you will have to lie down in it to play. You and a friend will play in opposite ends of the pen, looking for clues to solve one of many puns. (We think these puns are great but you probably think they are awful - but that is only because you didn't think of them.)</p>

        <p class="description">This all day every day game consists of two or more people getting together and speaking on what, if anything, is distracting us from this present moment. Thoughts of the past and the future, however valid, can sometime detract from our experience of this NOW moment. This clearing process opens the space to speak these thoughts and be heard, so that we are able to let them go and be in full enjoyment of the moment. While also being mindful of what is important to us as well. 
Through a series of three questions we, Camp Gratitude, intend to guide Burners back to enjoying the precious time we have here at Burning Man. 
The first question is usually along the lines of "What are you present to" followed by "While you are present to that how do you feel?" With the listener recreating what they heard back to the speaker, so there is a clear understanding and reflection for the person being cleared. After that there are two "Questions of the Day." The first QotD is directed towards an aspect of our ego or shadow side, and bringing it into light. By being conscious of these processes, and how we feel while present to them, we can work through them and utilize them.</p>

        <p class="description">The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009 and 2010, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2011!</p>

New recruits are welcome any time, and will be initiated through unique rites of passage and get to choose squirt guns and different-colored bandannas signifying their clan membership. Throughout the week, potentially hundreds of warriors will be encouraged to hunt members of rival clans (identified by their prominently displayed bandanas) all across the playa, working independently or taking part in large pre-scheduled shoot-outs. Black Rock warriors killed by the opposing gangs must sign their killers' bandanas to signify the coup, and remain dead until they resurrect that night at sunset--unless they perform a mutually-agreed-upon service for their killer (such as a funny dance, a gift of food or alcohol, or something crazier), in which case they resurrect immediately. Band together with your friends and get to know your enemies as you hunt complete strangers throughout the week! Nowhere is safe, unless you take off your bandana--but then you can't shoot anyone either, and who wants that? Hunt for favors, to meet new people, to have your victory recorded in the camp's log book, or for the sheer honor of the kill!</p>

Killed players hand over their game token to their killer. Simultanous kills are possible if shots are fired before received. Additional tokens may be obtained if you are killed. Creativity may be required to do so.

        <p class="description">Bobby Wheelock,  everyone's favorite Nazi Hitler clone from Brazil,  wants to give all participants on the playa their own individualized fun pack.  And we will need volunteers to help distribute these fun packs.

Bobby is a person who's DNA is cloned from a prominent German political figure who rose to fame in the 1930's.  Unlike his forefather,  Bobby loves and embraces Burning Man and has no xenophobic tendencies.  That being said.  Bobby wants to use his Charisma and swiss gold to gain control of Burning Man (oh no!).  Bobby came up with an administration pack to keep everyone in order. 
Luckily, Bobby's Blond Japanese triplet sexrataries did not like the plot and "influenced" us to modify the wording and put the "fun" into these flyers.

Each of the 50,000 flyers will be individualized for every participant,  and will have a bunch of games and jokes to go around.

As a bonus, a new religious movement is included, And there even is a special coupon to help with decommodification.

In order to deliver all these 50,000 fliers,  we will need 32 volunteers Wednsday at 9:00, located around the rim of the city.  After this,  everyone who wants to play should yell out "Gold for Goldie!" - which is the secret code.

And yes,  there are a select number of "Golden Tickets".

Legal Eagleez:
This is a good leave no trace giveaway,  as the 9 miles of flyers are easy to pick up.   Overt corporate sponsorship is kept to a minimum,  and no-one has the guts to claim this as a tax write-off.  Bobby is a fictional character from the 1977 movie "Boys from Brazil",  but his sexretaries are real.  Goldie is a woman who has gifted love,  and should be gifted back all the gold in the universe.</p>

So this year we set aside some time for them to show us how it’s really done. No adults allowed on the court, but feel free to come and cheer on the little bastards.</p>

        <p class="description">We are really excited to bring Geocaching awesomeness to burning man this year. Our theme/logo is “Let’s Cross Over” and we are looking at Geocaching as a way of promoting rites of passage and also the essence of our theme camp which is about marking significant transitions in the life cycle. Here are few golden words describing the gist behind our theme:
 
Leave behind something you love or something that will help you move forward. What you leave will tell your story and will create a vibration in the space and time. What you take will walk along with you in your journey. Lighten your hearts and cross over the hurdles and let this box hold your treasures.
 
 You can find the container (cache) at our theme camp “Tattoo Oasis” located at 9:30 and Anniversary.
 
Quick summary: "GEOCACHING is real-world outdoor treasure hunting. Participant find Geochaching containers (aka. cache) and once found, they put something in the container and take something out of the container. They can also choose to log their experiences in a log book found inside the container.” For more info on what Geocaching is all about go to http://www.geocaching.com/ and if you have any questions or want more details you can contact geeti at “geetaroma@gmail.com”</p>

        <p class="description">The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in 2009 and 2010, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2012!</p>

In this experiment in human biological compatibility, participants seal their pheromone-soaked clothing in an anonymous plastic bag.  Subjects sniff their way through each bag and mark the degree to which they’re attracted or replused by each smell.  After a little decompression, matches will be announced to the surprise and delight of all involved.   Both LGBT and Straight friendly.  All are welcome, but make sure to show up on time with a sweaty T-shirt if you want to participate!</p>

Yeah, stupid I know.  Well, your friends from Barbie Death Village and our subcontinental themecamp BollyVille will be hosting India's own version: The Punjabi Dating Game!  We need three eligable bachelors (or even more because there's enough of Ninzy to handle Gunga Din's personal hoardes) and come Friday evening before The Wall Street Burn out on the deep playa we will be hosting our show.  Complete with playa-sanctioned pyrotechnics, our 45 minute show will be an eye-popping experience indeed.  Head out beyond the Temple and look for the 21st Century version of The Dating Game set, pull up a chair, and get your curry on.  The winning bachelor and Ninzy will be whisked away in our very own Barbie's Mobile Whorehouse in plush comfort, complete with champagne and minions to act like sycophants to their very beck and call, and escorted to The Wall Street Burn.  Afterwards the lovely couple will come back to Barbie Death Camp to perhaps consumate their date.  Or not.  You never know for sure but one thing is certain:  A splendid time is guaranteed for all.</p>

Some quests are more challenging, like "Give away something very precious to you, accept nothing in return" and some leave your fate to chance... "Find the quiet man in the hat, tell him you are on a Vision Quest, ask him what to do next." ----------> Every quest has you interact with your fellow BRC citizens and step a little out of your comfort zone. -----------------> Spinning the wheels is a great way to see new things, meet new people, and maybe stumble onto a playa lesson or two. -----> Warning: Only spin the wheels if you plan on doing a quest before the end of the Burn... Our resident hippies have put weird hippy magic into the wheels... quests ignored may have unknown consequences... ------------------------ Right across from Center Camp at Blackrock Yearbook (Inner Circle and 4:44) Get your photo taken by the Yearbook while you are there!</p>

We have a number of different games that can even be mixed and matched. The Good, The Bad and the Munchkin, Munchkin Booty, Munchkin Bites, Star Munchkin, Munchkin Zombies, Munchkin Impossible and Munchkin Fu.

Battle the Banshee, Gregor, the Maggot or Frank Limejello. Wear the Pointy Hat of Great Power, Seven years of Ick, or the Evil Eye Shadow. Fight with your banana-fana-fo-faser or steam powered tomahawk.

We’ll try to have several games going and Munchkins and Mimosas until they run out.

        <p class="description">The now infamous camp challenge is back. With origins dating all the way back to the 1980s, this camping tradition has morphed into something truly monstrous. During the heat of the day, in triple digit temperatures, one must eat a helping of five-alarm chili, cooked with the dreaded Guatemalan insanity pepper (grown only by the inmates of a Guatemalan insane asylum). Then, to wash it down, a shot of hot pepper vodka, also infused with the same insanely hot pepper. Now, when you want nothing more than an ice-cold beverage to quench the fire burning in your mouth, you instead must chug a cheap, warm beer that's been sitting out in the sun since daybreak. Why, might you ask, would anyone want to do this? Hell if we know! It's a terrible idea! It's a horrible thing to conceive, much less do on purpose! Yet, as demonstrated by the droves of people who participated AND completed the challenge in past years, we apparently underestimated human nature. Not only did crowds show up for the challenge, but they returned over the course of the week to to share the pain with their friends. And by share, we mean point and laugh while grown men cried and stumbled down the street in a daze. We even had a university anthropologist come hangout, just to observe this odd aspect of human behavior.  We're bringing it back spicier than ever for 2013!</p>

        <p class="description">The Chakraland game is a 22×30 foot vinyl flooring of a multicolored human sized game that participants play by rolling the giant dice and moving towards the different colored squares, each square representing a different chakra. The layout is similar to the child’s game “Candyland”. The squares will all have different quests written on them that need to be completed in a certain timeframe, or players have to go back to the previous square of the same color. There are some short cuts, wild pink squares, and black lose-a-turn squares. The winner makes it to the end of the colored path and gets loved up by the colorful game jesters.</p>

As per usual in this sort of event, our highly esteemed panel of

dinner ensconced within and other equally tangible parameters that attest to the care and feeding of your personal face troll. Bribery and foolishness are considered de rigueur.

If you’ve seen the popular television show that inspired this game show then you know what to expect. Have fun, participate, and stick the zonk to the other guy!

We will lay a trail in BRC that you can run, jog, walk, slide, or bike through and end in a cold brew with a pack of crazies who sing songs, tell tall tales, and do our version of down-downs (crimes on trail). No red dress? So what! Anything red will do. Bring your bike if you don't like to run. Trail will be clearly marked with flags and there will be beverage stops along the way. You will have a great time. Come on, we won't bite you...hard.</p>

        <p class="description">The Last Resort Country Club and Day Disco will be hosting a tennis tournament on their tennis court. All are welcome but be prepared to demonstrate an array of skills. If you win a tennis match you may go on to the next round which could take you to a dance competition judged on racquet use and ability to hop the net. Fashion will play a large role obviously. Although this conservative tennis club will be disciplining anyone who breaks the Wimbledon all-white outfit policy, passes may be granted based on "who you know". Knowing the right people may even lead to a "no shirt, no shoes, no problem" attitude. The tennis court is regulation size, but as we move into nighttime, there could be non-standard court lighting in effect.
The Last Resort will be serving gin & tonics and other classic drinks during the entertainment. During intermissions, croquet comptetitions will be arranged on an ad-hoc basis for athletes who prefer sports that do not result in drink spillage.</p>

        <p class="description">Our project is inspired by the golden age of hand-held games. Milton Bradley debuted Simon in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York, and it remains a sweetheart of memory games and an enduring pop-culture reference to the 1980’s. We look to revive this great game in a playa-compliant fashion, offering the core gameplay intact but adding (external) flame, sound and light effects in the form of nearby sculpture. Game play will take place on an original (but deeply repurposed and reengineered) Simon hand-held console, which is synchronized with the sculpture piece (light, sound, flame). What the original game lacks, this project delivers: a win-condition with lighting, sound and flame effect display. Bluntly, we feel that a game of Simon to be passed around with a light, sound and flame effect display is a winning combination.</p>

        <p class="description">On Wednesday, August 28th at 5am, runners across the playa will begin the 50 kilometer run (31 miles) from Pink Lightning Camp. We'll run loops around the playa, traveling journeys in our mind that nothing can compete with. We'll dance with you as we run past, give out free sweaty hugs, and ask you to join us. There's still time to train, so dust off those running shoes and prepare to run what promises to be the funnest race of your life. There are competitive runners, those who are just out to have fun, and those who love the sufferfest and love. However you want to run, we have the race for you. Run with us for the race of a lifetime!

For more info, visit our website or email me with your name, gender, race date age, email address, regular address, emergency contact info for off and on the playa, and t-shirt size.

Volunteers (that significant other?) are also welcome to the party of a race.

Get ready to have the ultimate high: runner's high!

The Chakraland game is a 22×30 foot vinyl flooring of a multicolored human sized game that participants play by rolling the giant dice and moving towards the different colored squares, each square representing a different chakra. The layout is similar to the child’s game “Candyland”. The squares will all have different quests written on them that need to be completed in a certain timeframe, or players have to go back to the previous square of the same color. There are some short cuts, wild pink squares, and black lose-a-turn squares. The winner makes it to the end of the colored path and gets loved up by the colorful game jesters. Yay, so much fun!</p>

The Weak Dusty is an fun endurance event where you’ll run a 2-5 mile course with military-style obstacles though various camps, starting and ending at Pink Lighting (home of BM 50K Ultramarathon, on Wednesday).  

Designed by Very Special Forces to test mental as well as physical strength, obstacles play on common fears, such as heights, burners, dubstep, monkey bars, sparkle ponies and jungle gyms.

The Weak Dusty encourages teamwork and partner/group participation. Participants must commit to helping others complete the course, putting teammates before themselves, overcoming fears and occasionally administering booze to those who need more. The event is untimed, and may involve strong alcoholic beverages for additional challenge and fun. 

Don't miss your workouts, you lazy and/or overly indulgent Burner!  Your body will thank you when you're back next week in default world...</p>

Funky beats will help move your feets as you jockey for position on one of the numbered place-mats (think musical chairs). Numbers will be drawn and if you find yourself on the winning place-mat, you win! Piece of cake! 

There will be many chances to win but a cake-thirsty attitude is strongly recommended. No one said this would be a cake walk! (wait...)

        <p class="description">Mashup Mania is a game show where two players are competing to see who can recognize the most elements of a mashup or cover song. In the case of a cover song, for example, they could name the original band and song name, and the band currently doing the cover.  For a mashup, they could name the different performers, and the different songs, depending on how many songs are being mashed up.  Each correct answer gets 1 point for whoever rings on first, but if they miss any question, the other player gets to hear 10 more seconds and has the opportunity to answer, and gets TWO points for each answer.  This is so that players don't just rush to buzz in if they recognize only one component.  First one to 10 with at least two points more than their opponent wins (kind of like volleyball scoring).  Depending on how many players, we would have an elimination tournament.</p>

You can satisfy your architecture or construction interests by building structures that may be original, that represent real world architecture, or perhaps one that is as tall as you can engineer.

More importantly, you can then share the artist's childhood by spectacularly toppling your structure with your friends after it's determined complete, which is sometimes a matter of varied opinions ...

Awards will be named in several categories based on photos you submit of your work and its destruction.</p>

        <p class="description">We're offering an automated gift exchange service and a crowd-sourced kissing  booth that distributes gifts and kisses among a web of people. The person giving the gift/kiss is almost never the person the receiver exchanges their item with. 

Participants can come and list what they want or may have to gift/kiss. If a participant doesn't have something, we'll provide a gift of their choosing. Then using a trade-loop algorithm a web of exchanged items is created that pairs participants with gifts they want.  For those who only wish to give, we photograph them and give their item's recipient their photo/information to potentially interact with later. 

All exchanges/kisses are executed daily at noon. Please come before or after to browse/list or join in the chaos of the exchange!</p>

        <p class="description">Jamrunner is a "Journey to the End of the Night" styled game (ie: zombie tag, spy tag). 

Between evading pursuers, there is an interactive story that will unfold the longer a player remains in the game. The more resources I have available to me, the more enriched I can make this experience. I will need LOTS of printed materials, including maps and dossiers.

If you'd like to join (or know a person/camp who can help) let me know! See below for details.

The story:
Businessman and Nevada oligarch, Randall "Buck" Thurlough, is about to deal a deathblow to decommodification at Burning Man. The Order of Greywater Cockatoos is waging a subversive campaign against this corporate takeover. You are a member of this underground movement led by the elusive culture jammer, Darwin Sandiego.

Be careful! Thurlough's influence has grown to the point that he has successfully installed his own hired muscle at the festival. Private contractors of the notorious Pike River Security Firm roam the playa. If they catch you, they'll coerce you into turning on your fellow operatives.</p>

        <p class="description">While carnival boardwalks and midways are perfumed with the smell of Coney dogs, and funnel cakes, and dotted with souvenir shops, we transform the people into the attractions for others to enjoy.  There is a juxtaposition of who receives the excitement and who gives the excitement with an ample supply of tighty-whitey under pants in various styles.  The inner artists can express their creativity and dusty taints through colored markers then don the one-of-a-kind art. Snap a picture (instant camera on site) for our “Taint Wall of Freaks” then take your art on a traveling show - the living canvas of “the self”.
Monday/Tuesday – Foreplay! To get one excited and invigorated.  “Manifest it Monday”, “Free for all Tuesday”. You call it; it’s yours, especially our bartenders.  Monday and Tuesday are the days we establish our regulars!  We play “The Game” until we just can’t stand it anymore (In a good way of course).  It’s all about introducing ourselves to our neighbors and making friends for the week, friends for a lifetime.</p>

It's like driving your own personal pedal powered art car for 3 minutes or however long you last. The TENT is a SHADY OASIS in the DAY and a LIT-UP BEACON of fun at NIGHT!

 Winners of each race are determined by a mysterious mix of whatever the announcers at the time deem worthy. Is it the number of rear end or T-bone collisions you make happen? or maybe how many crashes you nimbly avoid with expert driving skills. Or maybe your winning attitude. Or your crazy costume. Maybe you cross the finish line first. Maybe you cross it last or not at all. You might still be a WINNER. We're betting on it! KIDS tall enough to pedal are welcome. Adults of ALL AGES brave or timid welcome. ALL Spectators welcome too! Come into the center ring and heckle your friends in the races!

PEDALING is FUN but BUMPING is EVEN BETTER! Seriously, the bumpers keep you safe and you will laugh your ass off with every bump, crash, skid or pass. 

We also welcome volunteers who want to help with PIT CREW duties! Wrangle the crowds, heckle the riders, keep the pedal carts repaired. Sign up for our newsletter on our FB page or just stop by anytime we are live on Playa!</p>

Hobos would write this code with chalk or coal to provide directions, information, and warnings to others in "the brotherhood". A symbol would indicate "turn right here", "beware of hostile railroad police", "dangerous dog", "food available here", and so on.</p>

        <p class="description">Everybody loves to sue everybody else in the good old U.S. of A!  So we here at Camp Dusty Justice are celebrating that practice and bringing an open, slightly impartial, fun venue for Burners of all stripes to get their dusty dirty day in court.  

Bring your case!  You will be heard!  Is it your noisy neighbor? (we had one!)  Did your best childhood friend make out with your girlfriend? (a real issue from last year)  Did a campmate drink your last cold beer?  Maybe it was just your turn to drive the art car.  Whatever the dispute, our jurist will sort it out.

We will hold court three times during the week or if an emergency arises.  Join us Monday afternoon, Wednesday afternoon and Friday afternoon from 4:30-6:30 for fun, laughs, and some serious judgments and some wicked punishments.</p>

        <p class="description">What: The Seventh Annual Burning Man Ultramarathon.

How: Pull on your running sneakers, grab a bottle of water or hydration pack, your favorite energy snacks, and hit the playa for one of the most unique and insane 50ks out there. Wear whatever you love best while running – whether that’s a tutu, sports bra and tights, or nothing at all.

Where: Black Rock City (Nevada – exact location info here)

When: Tuesday, August 30th, 2016, 5 a.m.

Who: You! Burners and ultrarunners of all types!

Why: Because it’s fun. Because it’s insane. Because it’s the ultimate high. Because you want to challenge yourself. Because we are working on really rad finishers’ presents! Because the race is a party! Because you don’t mind people chasing after you with bottles of whiskey while you run!

What else: Pink Lightning Camp will be the race headquarters, start, finish, and aid station. Stop by to view the big map, results, ask questions, use our foam rollers and running sticks, or just hang out with some friendly folks. During the race, we’ll have cocktails, fun, music, and lots of cheering. Have your friends come to the healthiest party on the playa! Come on by to volunteer, hang out, pace, or run!</p>

Join us for the 2nd annual Black Rock City Beer Mile!!!!

Drink a beer, run 400 meters, drink a beer, run 400 meters, drink a beer, run 400 meters, drink a beer, run 400 meters.

If you puke, you need to drink a penalty beer.

All participants MUST bring their own beers (a 6 pack is best in case you puke) AND you MUST run with a large ziploc bag (in case you puke, bc Burning Man is a Leave No Trace Event). 

All beer mile rules must be followed:
http://www.beermile.com/rules

Please arrive a few minutes early for registration (yep, numbers this year). Heckling is encouraged. This will be fun. Sometimes, the best beer milers are NOT runners...and sometimes, the best runners are NOT good beer milers. It's fun no matter what!</p>

When those same concepts are applied to social interaction, AMAZING things come in to existence.   The Game has a simple premise; Draw a card from the deck and the player does what is written. “The Game” has a tendency to create possibilities where there were once boundaries. Choices where there were once obstacles. “The Game”: the love child of truth or dare, charades, post office, twister, spin the bottle, and "American's Got talent".. “The Game” is perfect for letting one's imagination out to play. Watch what happens when permission is given to create, with wanton abandon. “The Game” is both a game of chance and skill if you want to believe that.  Remove a self-limiting perspective, gain new insights in creative problem solving.  Come play 'The Game'</p>

Prizes and good times awarded to all who participate. No wooks allowed. It is important to make the distinction between a hippie and a wook. Hippies can generally be viewed as positive, optimistic members of society with an idealistic goal for the betterment of society. Wooks are everything that you've been warned about in regard to hippies wrapped into a neat little package. As a side note we may do this more than the days we have listed, if you find yourself up and about, looking for shenanigans around sunrise roll through the 12:00 zone between the man and temple and see if we are there, It's pretty hard to miss a 60' kickball field.</p>

Bua buei"
Bua-buei means throwing divine blocks.
Buei blocks are very common divination tools in Taiwanese temples,which are used in pairs and thrown to get a yes or no answer from gods.
They are made out of wood and carved into a crescent shape.Each block is round on one side (known as the Yin side) and flat on the other (known as the Yang side).
When throwing the blocks, there are three possible results: One block flat and another block round is a ‘yes’ answer.Both blocks flat is a “maybe” answer. Both blocks round is a ‘no’ answer.
​
"Fortune Sticks"
During a ritual, the querent will light an incense,
Bua-buei and accompanied by drawing fortune sticks to clarify an oracle.
​
"Talisman"

The participant can get inked by a  Burning Mazu talismanic stamp, then enter ouracupressure massage dome.</p>
