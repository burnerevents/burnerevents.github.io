        <p class="description">Come join us for the celebration of a Decade of Dicking !!
We have a VERY special treat in hand for what should be the BIGGEST march yet !!.

The Critical Dicks March began as a natural male response to the glorious annual Critical Tits bike ride, which of course is a take-off on the famous Critical Mass bike ride, which in turn is a pun on the nuclear physics term for the amount of a radioactive substance required to begin spontaneous nuclear fission, which was discovered by a bunch of scientists like Albert Einstein, who, for the most part had DICKS. (OK, Marie Curie was a notable exception, but she was HOT. Talk about a nuclear family!) So ya see, what comes around, goes around. 

The Critical Dicks March welcomes all genders: Male, Female, Transsexual, Intersexual, Pansexual, Gay, Bi, Straight, and Bent. However, if you are not naturally blessed with a dick, please bring a long a reasonable fucksimile. 
CRITICAL DICKS is a MARCH, not a bike ride, but if you must bring your bike, we have people who will properly guard your bike until you return for it.
The March starts at noon on Thursday, directly in front of the Man.

And now, let the testosterone flow! Stand proud and erect as you march through the streets of Black Rock City! Cast of the cruel duds of oppression! You have nothing to lose but your shame!</p>

You can even play with the Burning Band,so bring a random musical instrument or just use your scratchy voice for singing.</p>

Yes, we invented booze last year.  We then shook it all up and sprayed it with dust and threw snow-balls at it.  There was much fun and silliness.  Many dirty hippies were washed with lofted snowballs and alcohol.  Many camps, bars, and "smarty-pants" were straight snow-bombed because they didn't like Santa.


Remember, when Santa comes a-knocking, those bottles better be a-pouring.  
These Santas will make your camp a-rocking, even if you wanted it to stay a-snoring.
We can't stop the Santa a-cocking, with enough booze though, we'll be Santa a-flooring!
Many people will be Santa a-gawking, but share a drink, please! Santa's imploring!</p>

We bring magick and innocence to the playa and we fart butterflies and poop rainbows. There is a rumor that we eat bunnies, and it is true, but only with their consent.
In the Enchanted Forest we are always having big lovely orgies with our friends. We like orgies, and we are always horny!!
This year, for the first time, we are having a stampede, taking our unbridled joy and annoyingly perky enthusiasm across the playa. Join us! We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival. We will start at the Unicorn Ranch at Esplanade and 3.45, gathering from 5-6pm, and then stampeding around who knows where as the sun sets. We will provide horns and other unicorny costuming to those who are horn deficient. We really can't wait to meet you! Squeeeee!</p>

damn glad we're still here. And honor those who have passed. And give
very serious love to those of us still fighting every day to squeeze
every drop of joy out of life that we can. Because we cherish life like you
wouldn't believe. 

We're meeting at the MAN (facing the temple) at 9pm and walk to the
Temple. It has become a reunion of sorts. It's moving. It's happy.
It's celebratory. It's about love and life.

        <p class="description">The Critical Dicks March began in the year 2000 as a natural male response to the glorious annual Critical Tits bike ride , which of course is a take-off on the famous Critical Mass bike ride, which in turn is a pun on the nuclear physics term for the amount of a radioactive substance required to begin spontaneous nuclear fission, which was discovered by a bunch of scientists like Albert Einstein, who, for the most part had DICKS. (OK, Marie Curie was a notable exception, but she was HOT. Talk about a nuclear family!) So ya see, what comes around, goes around. 

The Critical Dicks March welcomes all genders: Male, Female, Transsexual, Intersexual, Pansexual, Gay, Bi, Straight, and Bent. However, if you are not naturally blessed with a dick, please bring a long a reasonable fucsimile. 

And now, let the testosterone flow! Stand proud and erect as you march through the streets of Black Rock City! Cast of the cruel duds of oppression! You have nothing to lose but your shame!
 
The parade starts at NOON, on thursday, in front of the man!
This is a MARCHING parade, so please... leave your bikes somewhere else!</p>

Each panel member can award points on a scale of 1-10 for:

In the event of a tie we ask the audience to cheer for their choice and the entrant with the loudest cheer will win.

(OK, Marie Curie was a notable exception, but she was HOT. Talk about a nuclear family!) So ya see, what comes around, goes around. 

The Critical Dicks March welcomes all genders: Male, Female, Transsexual, Intersexual, Pansexual, Gay, Bi, Straight, and Bent. However, if you are not naturally blessed with a dick, please bring a long a reasonable fucsimile. 

And now, let the testosterone flow! Stand proud and erect as you march through the streets of Black Rock City! Cast of the cruel duds of oppression! You have nothing to lose but your shame!

The Critical Dicks March has a long history, and is best pulled off in protest fashion, so now is the time to stand up tall and demand equal rights for your Dick!!!</p>

There is a rumor that we eat bunnies, and it is true, but only with their consent. They like it. It tickles. Then they turn into candy.

In the Enchanted Forest we are always having big lovely orgies with our friends. We like orgies, and we are always horny!! At burningman we are having a stampede, taking our unbridled joy and annoyingly perky enthusiasm across the playa.

Join us! We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival.

We will start at 6.30pm, and then stampede around who knows where as the sun sets. We will provide horns to those who are horn deficient. We really can't wait to meet you! Squeeeee!</p>

        <p class="description">Attention bikers, pedestrians, stilt walkers, zombies, bunnies and electric vehicles alike.
 
Meet at the Man Thursday at 1630h if you’re ready to join "CO2 Green Drive" and show how to get from A to B in style using human and renewable energy powered transportation solutions.
 
Yes. We want all you electric people to show your colors and join us when we complete a CO2 shaped route on the open playa starting from the Man. With the help of a smartphone Application all can be part of a GPS CO2 shaped "tag" as we parade our way through Black Rock City. Essentially, we will all be live brushes, smartphone technology the paint and Black Rock City our playground and canvass.
 
And if you prefer to enjoy your Burning Man experience off-line there is no need to download the APP. Just hop along and join the parade.

The concept stems from the experimental Art, Climate & Technology Project “CO2 Green Drive”. The CO2 Green Drive Project was devised in connection with the UN Climate Summit COP15 in Copenhagen/December 2009. Since 2009 the project has been performed 23 times in 19 cities on five continents "tagging" these with citywide CO2 "paintings". In April 2012 the project was performed simultaneously in 12 cities on five continents.

Using art and culture as a universal language CO2 Green Drive seeks to promote a sustainable and fertile future in all its aspects. It's time art shows the way via physically engaging, playfull and fun activities supporting abundant life everywhere. 
 
Around the world this has included bikers and skaters in Dakar, electric vehicles in New York and runners in India. Next Stop Nevada.
 
At Burning Man we hope to see lots of bikes, tri-bikes- quadro-bikes, pedestrians, stilt walkers, bunnies, things we don't even know how to name and electric art cars ... and, well, perhaps with a couple of zombies thrown in.

        <p class="description">Due to the extra traffic of our bourgeoning population pouring into the playa, the dust is expected to be much worse this year, so much so that they’re calling it Futility 2.0. Even the Black Rock Rangers have faltered as their ranks have questioned their resolve in the face of such a menace. They need not fear, for The French Maid Brigade will once again provide their services gratis to the community of Black Rock City. Once again our citizens can rest assured that they will be protected from any and all dusty intrusions. 

Each year one or two rookie French Maids spend extra time addressing the situation with the Rangers only to realize, “Wait, they actually dress to look like dust!” Indeed, if you could magnify a dust particle five billion times, you would see the likeness of a Black Rock Ranger. Clearly the Rangers have succumbed to the mentality of “If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em." The French Maids have no such intentions with dust, will never surrender, and continue to support the radical self-expression of all who dwell on the playa through maintaining a dust-free environment for all who participate.

Many enquiries are made every year as to how one might join such a venerable organization. You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa. Stop by our camp anytime for official recruitment or rendezvous with us on the playa. Please bring: non-feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, any other useful cleaning equipment, and your worst possible French accent. On Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!</p>

This informal bike tour is hosted by volunteers from the ARTery (6:25 & Esplanade). A curated group of art projects will be visited and discussed. This tour will begin at 10:00 AM and run approximately 60-90 minutes. The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided Tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites. It takes every single one of us to make Burning Man happen...</p>

There is a rumor that we eat bunnies, and it is true, but only with their consent. They like it. It tickles. Then they turn into candy. In the Enchanted Forest we are always having big lovely orgies with our friends. We like orgies, and we are always horny!! At burningman we are having a stampede, taking our unbridled joy and annoyingly perky enthusiasm across the playa. Join us! We will be galloping around making a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival. We will start at 6.30pm, and then stampede around who knows where as the sun sets. We will provide horns to those who are horn deficient. We really can't wait to meet you! Squeeeee!</p>

        <p class="description">As John Frum said, “Let there be ART!” this year consider finding out more about the fantastic art projects at Burning Man! This informal bike tour is hosted by volunteers from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). A curated group of art projects will be visited and discussed. This tour will begin at 10:00 AM and run approximately 60-90 minutes. The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided Tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites. It takes every single one of us to make Burning Man happen...</p>

This sample parade will feature 25-50 art vehicles and include other unique marching groups of macabre and curiosity…bells and whistles…pomp and poop.  The Parade route will begin on the Playa at 10:00 and G…continue across the Playa in front of the Burning Man…and end on the Playa at 2:00 and G.  The achieved goal is to have a meet and greet parade to introduce many of the art vehicles, theme camp organizations, and collective artists for public recognition and interest. Support your local future parade! For Parade information please contact Doug of Reverbia at The Greatest Mutant Art Parade Experiment Facebook page…TBC.</p>

A curated group of art projects will be visited and discussed. This tour will begin at 10:00 AM and run approximately 60-90 minutes, weather permitting. The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided Tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites. It takes every single one of us to make Burning Man happen...</p>

Please follow the tour guide while the group do all kinds of touristy activities in the Man Pavilion, which will end up marching down to Burninja Meetup where burners from Japan welcome you as fellow tourists.</p>

It's time to claim our rights and the rights of all veggie-kind to be treated as the sentient beings we are. 

All Carrots and Allies assemble in your finest green and orange attire for a pre-party from 4pm-6pm at 7:30 & A in the French Quarter before the Billion Bunny March. In true Carrot fashion, we’ll provide drinks, music and much entertainment before we head out to intercept the bunnies at 6pm sharp! 

Bring along your singing voice and your best vegetable themed cocktails to share. While pro carrot, we're certainly a vegetable-friendly group.

Practice your chants, learn some Carrot songs (http://goo.gl/IpyjQ) and, most importantly, join us as our wave of orange and green goodness spreads across the playa!</p>

A curated group of art projects will be visited and discussed. This tour will begin at 10:00 AM and run approximately 60-90 minutes, weather permitting. The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade). Note that there are also ART TOUR - Guided tour (search Playa Events), and self guided tours (paper copies) available at the ARTery. Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites. It takes every single one of us to make Burning Man happen...</p>

Feel like there's less to you than meets the eye? Have only just enough artistic skill to draw a stick figure? You may be one of us! If you have one of these costumes, or want to make one, then get to it! We need you to join us as we dance across the darkness and spread joy throughout the land. Stickman BRC has been illustrating our EL wire childlike magic on the Playa since 2004, bringing art to life. Over the years, we've seen others infuse their creativity into the ranks of Stickhood and we think its time we unite. Nothing sadder than a lonesome Stickman.

Meet at (6:30/Esplanade) at 9:30pm Tuesday night, September 1st; at 10pm, we venture out to the Playa. We'll be on foot, route tbd, so wear your walkin'/dancin' shoes. We hope you can play with us!

Join the FB page (and check the files) for info on how to make one.

        <p class="description">Now that Burning Man has become a maker fair under the aegis of the Renaissance Faire, there is a lot more than the usual dust up over the direction and identity of this quaint event in the Nevada desert. This year’s dust shall be comprised of marble, sandstone, oak, and pewter, a highly controversial mixture never before introduced to the Black Rock desert. Because they don’t mess around when it comes to preserving intact the native chemical profile of the immediate environment of the Black Rock desert, the Bureau of Land Management has mandated extra precautions for 2016. As such, the BLM has required that BMOrg retain the services of the French Maid Brigade. It’s nothing we wouldn’t be doing anyway. 

Rendezvous with us! You too can be one of the sexiest clean freaks on the playa—please bring: feather dusters, rags, dustbusters, service carts, vacuums, white gloves, latex gloves, enema kits, lube, and any other useful cleaning equipment. Join us in uniform with your surly attitude and worst possible French accent.

On Thursday at 2:00 pm we meet at 3 O’Clock and Esplanade then dust our way through every filthy, nasty camp on our march toward that dust bucket known as Center Camp Café, liberate them from their dusty oppression, and celebrate our triumph!</p>

Look for the parade on its rogue route around Noon on the Playa, through the City...where???  We cannot tell you.  But we will at one point drive past 3:45 and along the Esplanade as each vehicle is given the respect of introduction.  ****All interested participant vehicles and people who would like to assist...then ride in the parade...contact us via email.</p>

        <p class="description">The collective noun for unicorns is a Fabulus of unicorns, not a blessing as the Internet will tell you. So come join The Fabulus Unicorns for a gathering of horns for a Glampede as we gallop across the Playa spreading the sparkle in a Rainbowgasm of fun, color and sexiness. 

Help us raise the vibration and of course make a nuisance of ourselves, stampeding through people's camps spreading our intolerably positive energy throughout the festival.

It's time to claim our rights and the rights of all veggie-kind to be treated as the sentient beings we are. All Carrots and Allies assemble in your finest green and orange attire for a pre-party from 4pm-6pm at the 4:30 Portal in the French Quarter before the Billion Bunny March. In true Carrot fashion, we’ll provide drinks, music and much entertainment before we head out to intercept the bunnies at 6pm sharp! Bring along your singing voice and your best vegetable themed cocktails to share. While pro carrot, we're certainly a vegetable-friendly group. Practice your chants, learn some Carrot songs (http://goo.gl/IpyjQ) and, most importantly, join us as our wave of orange and green goodness spreads across the playa!</p>
