Every other night the Heart Machine operates by will of the people and their interactions with its nervous system.  For one special night the Order of the Machinists will take over the Heart Machine and treat our Metropolis citizens to a choreographed fire show. 

The Heart Machine needs human contact and interaction so we welcome you to sit, lay, cuddle, hug or raise your voices within the perimeter of the Heart Machine.  Come bask in the heat - and there will be heat - of our 14 foot tall flaming arteries.  Did we mention these arteries shoot fire ranging from 2 feet to 20 feet?  Did we warn you about the sonic booms Canadian made solenoids make; who needs smoke signals when we can communicate with booms the sound of kettle drums?  

The Order of the Machinists hail from Ontario Canada and the Heart Machine is our gift to you: our Black Rock City community.  It's always good to come home!

If you have extra 100LB propane tanks you wish to donate for the night (we will give them back) we may event make larger and longer sonic flaming booms to keep you warm.</p>

        <p class="description">Come on down for a round of flaming tetherball. Find a myself (mr. dug) or a fellow bat so we can lend you a pair of welder's gloves and light up. Instead of hitting the ball as in traditional tetherball, you are encouraged to grab the ball and throw or swing it. Keep your wits about you, this is real fire. Aggressive play can result in the whole thing tipping over, so go easy. 

We have optional face shields which are great if you get hit in the face, but they tend to fog up and are generally less than comfortable. If you have a suggestion for improved face protection, we welcome ideas. 


People always ask how you win. Personally, I think if you're playing, you've already won. But if you simply must sort out a winner, a point is scored when you wrap the chain all the way around the pole till it can't go any further. Your opponent tries to stop that by trying to do the same thing in the opposite direction. How many points? Whatever. 

And feel free to pass the ball on to a friend before the fire burns out, because it's important that we let the ball cool down over a shot of whiskey in between burns.</p>

        <p class="description">Join us for the spectacular final burning of the Aeolian Pyrophonic Hall & Whispering Wall, AKA "the Portal" featuring a performance extravaganza with the world premier of Apterous, a stilt dance performance featuring a tribe of giant winged creatures into which is born a creature without wings.  Giant wings, whirling, tall beings, broken children and quirky redemption emerge from the playa for the burning of the Portal. Born wingless, an outcast in a tribe of giant winged stilted creatures, Apterous claims the beauty of his destiny and opens a Portal of possibilities for his people. Apterous features incredible costuming, giant wings and the talents of 27 dancers.

We will light the structure on fire, and the flames engulfing the lacy walls will be the stage on which this performance unrolls.  

Accompanied by fire organ and harp soundscape, this performance features the ritual removal of the Whispering Wall scroll after a week of collecting the hopes, fears, dreams, secrets and whispers of the citizens of Black Rock City.  A procession will carry the scroll of our intentions into the Temple after the burning of the Portal structure.</p>

        <p class="description">Beneath a giant sledge hammer, moving industrial images of frantic workers are visible through skylights on the ground, suggesting the enormous power turbines underneath the city need a "bump start". Infinity mirror tunnels, whirling roof vents and a submerging conveyor belt filled with tools for the workers below completes the vision. Three regular-sized sledgehammers are the tools for interaction. When a participant slams one down on their target, a deep, audible "boom" shakes the ground, feet, ankles, etc. The more simultaneously the three hammers are struck, the higher the tongues of flame travel up the giant hammer itself. If the three participants get the flames all the way to the top, the hammerhead spins with liquid fire, unfolds, and reflects shafts of light downward like an infernal disco ball as the underground turbines audibly groan up to speed. Strength and accuracy matter not-- it's all in the timing. Ein Hammer is a tribute to workers as one.</p>

A:  Heckle the crap out of them, of course! 

Fire Idol returns for its fourth year on the playa, with even more fire, heckling and insanity. This event is so extreme it can only be contained by Death Guild’s Thunderdome! A parody of the T.V. show “American Idol” Fire Performers will compete for Fire Trophies by surviving their elimination round, only to come face-to-face with our three Fire Idol Judges in round two.  As always, our judges appreciate bribes. 

 Round One:  4 men enter. One man leaves.  As always, women are welcome and encouraged to compete. Spin your hearts out to really bad music, while being heckled by our M/C and Fire Idol judges.

 Round Two: One man enters. Alone. Your mission: to survive the intense tongue lashing from our Judges with your dignity, ego and sense of humor intact. Top three winners are gifted mini-thunderdome fire (propane) trophies.

 Bring your gear (and your balls).  We’ll provide the fuel (white gas only). Signups begin 1/2 hour prior to the event at Death Guild’s Thunderdome.

 Warning:  this event is for immature audiences only.  Pansies, cry-babies, the truly untalented, and those with fragile egos need not apply.  On second thought, maybe this is exactly what you need!  Come on down.

“Congratulations. You're the first to survive the audition…”

        <p class="description">We are thrilled to announce the third annual Circle of Regional Effigies (CORE) comprised of wooden sculptures created by Burning Man Regional groups from around the world! This year's configuration will see 4 circles of six effigies placed around the base of the Man that will burn together on Thursday night at exactly 9pm to create the world's largest intentional simultaneous Burn!

Guided by the Ten Principles, CORE teams work together throughout the Spring and Summer to create art that celebrates their Regional identities and showcases the collaborative artistic efforts of their community members. The CORE Project is a celebration of Burning Man's Regional Network and of the work that groups throughout the world are doing to nurture and support the Burning Man ethos as a global cultural movement.

2013's Circle of Regional Effigies will include the highest number of international Regional groups to date with groups from Taiwan, Israel, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Czech Republic, and France joining the circle.
If you are joining us on the playa, visit the Everywhere Pavilion on the Esplanade to get placement maps, and read more info about each effigy, meet with Regional Contacts and CORE artists and collaborators.
In the meantime, please read about the pieces on the Burning Man website, so you can understand them better, and enjoy them that much more during your time in BRC.

•••Tour de CORE Monday 7-10pm•••
There will be a TOUR DE CORE Celebration of the Regional Effigies on Monday evening. This is the time to come out to the CORE project and visit with the creators and builders and see what they have to share with you about their projects. This is Black Rock City's moment to honor these groups for their exceptional work!

        <p class="description">Standing on a 8’ tall altar, the 6-armed idol reaches 30' into the air to spew fireballs from flame-cannons mounted at the end of each arm, beseeching the Deep-Voiced Spirits in the Sky to bring cosmic cargo to the dusty city.
As the desert burners gather at the feet of the idol, they cogitate into a prayer-trance, beaming waves of mental energy, focusing and preparing for the bearers of cosmic cargo. Using brainwave-oracles to channel mental energy, the supplicants invoke the Tesla-Jinn and energize the cargo ritual, producing a fiery prayer-ring-of-hands, circling overhead faster and faster, and as the coil begins to energize a hoary crown of high voltage discharge develops a dome of plasma, arcing and sparking wildly, as the electromagnetic prayer is transmitted out into the heavens, and as the transubstantiation is at zenith the distant sound of approaching Voices can be heard, building in volume as a host of heavily-laden, ground-shaking, cargo-bearing bird machines bears down on the encampment, growing louder and louder until the thunderous, throbbing drone of a chorus of engines shakes the tower and brings an eruption of devotional energy as precious cosmic cargo rains down upon the blessed worshipers of dust and fire. Weather permitting.

We invite you to strap on a brainwave "oracle" and watch the monitor as you control your brainwaves and fire the flame cannons, invoking the "Cosic Cargo Routine".

Brain cleansing services may be available throughout the day but we cannot commit to being properly staffed except on the posted time and date. We expect to be operational each night around dusk at the Hookah Lounge, providing at least one of the operating crew still survives and is able to awake the Jinn.</p>

The tasting will be followed at 10 pm by KSF Happy Hour and DJ Ronabell Vudu, with fire spinners, swallowers, and breathers from the Garnish Fire Conclave and friends (you can bring your toys and fuel too if you want to play!). DJ Ronabell spins erotic and energetic fuck beats to get your ass dancing: EBM, synthpop, industrial, and electronic.</p>

When the word is given, the citizens of Black Rock City will use their mirrors to reflect sunlight at the center of the sun mandala at the top of the tower to try to start a fire in the cannon fuse placed there that will then set the rest of the tower ablaze.
