Over heated little ones in need and under their teens may ask anytime during the day whether we have any shaving Ice to cool them down.    Enjoy fine shaved Snow with Sour electrolytes or Sweet Syrups in flavors of our choice as we deny you your desires in life and give you what we know you need, sorta like in real life but a bit worse.    Success of your quest is Highly dependent on the Ice supply which, once shaved, flavored and ingested can Melt quickly in the heat of the day. Ask about solutions to a shortage if this happens and you still have a severe need of Cool.    If the Ice has melted with no solutions available, you can still stop by and cool off for a minute in our self venting dust reducing open front shade Contraption and watch the city roll by as you cool down again to prepare for your next trek down the chosen path.  Please let any BRC Rangers or Emergency response volunteers to cut into line for a quick cooling if they stop by.  The Contraptionists also Host Naked Misted Twister at the same time of day which is for Adults only and screened with no spectators allowed. See information on N.M.T. and our other hosted attractions at Contraptionists listed here in the online directory and in the Who What Where directory on the Playa separately, or on our website Contraptionists.com.</p>

        <p class="description">Black Rock Scouts is a program for Burning Man kids, based on the Ten Principals of Burning Man. The goal is to teach kids what it takes to sustain life at Burning Man, how embrace their creativity, teach playa-survival skills and teach them how to get involved in their BRC community, not just skip through it. The ultimate goal is to inspire kids to volunteer as they grow up, take ownership of their community and become model burners. 

Camps, services and the Black Rock community will host playa-cational events and offer volunteer opportunities for kids. Scouts will earn patches, tokens or pins for things learned, survival skills achieved, volunteering, good deeds and connections made, to be worn on functional bandoleer sashes. Funds are being raised for patches, but hosts are welcome to provide patches, tokens, pendants or pins.

The hope is that the Black Rock community will accept and value Burner-kids as a vital part of their community, after all... they are the future of Burning Man.

Join us on Facebook and Yahoo Groups. Event schedule will be posted on Yahoo Groups, at Playa Info and Kidsville Center Camp. Volunteers and funds for patches are needed, so contact us if you'd like to help.</p>

        <p class="description">Come spin twirl and whirl in celebration and watch the horizon change from dark to light until you collapse in a fit of laughter glory and dizziness.

Last year at sunrise at the foot of where the man used to be we were warming ourselves after a night of... well lots of things really... we saw a man in a white suit rise, walk towards the sun, and start spinning with his arms outstretched. "I wanna do that" my friend said immediately as she rose from our warm coodle and started towards the man. Before we knew it another group started towards the man with us. We all outstretched our arms and slowly began spinning... As I spun faster and faster I started noticing the horizon line as it changed from dark to light dark to light. I started loosing my sense of where I was and this only made me want to spin faster. I could hear my friends giggling out of one ear then the other one then the other like stereo speakers. Trying to maintain my balance I spun as fast as I could and for as long as possible until I collapsed in a puddle of laughter. As the world spun around me all my friends stumbled toward me and fell upon me into a giant coodle. 

I thought it would be fun share this experience and see a large group of ppl together spinning at sunrise. Bring props to spin like streamers etc. Bring your friends etc.</p>

        <p class="description">The Animus Arts Collective is doing an interactive theater piece called The Hero's Journey for kids on playa this year.  Influenced heavily by Joseph Campbell’s theory of the Monomyth — the one archetypal quest within all quests — the Journey combines elements from legends and folklore the world around. The Hero will pull a sword from an enchanted scabbard, learn lessons from sage masters, unearth magical treasure, and solicit the favor of the gods. He or she will face a series of riddles on the course of an epic odyssey and ultimately lead an army of foam-sword wielding Burners into battle against the Evil Wizard.

The Hero’s Journey was inspired directly by the 2011 Burning Man theme Rites of Passage. It has toured festivals and festivities in the New York City region in preparation for this year’s Burn, most recently at Revolutionary War era Fort Jay on Governor’s Island in NYC.</p>

About Hardware: 


Black Rock City Municipal Hardware Shoppe is a Burning Man theme camp that has been a part of the event since 1999. Their primary mission is to provide tools, materials, and skills as a public service to the fellow citizens of Black Rock City. They pride themselves on their ability to fix (or at least juryrig) almost any problem you can think up. The more interesting it is, the harder we’ll work to give you the best fix possible. If they can’t fix it or suggest somebody else who can, they will give you a big hug to help you forget your troubles.</p>

Black Rock Scouts and their parents will meet at the center of Kidsville and we will walk to the Lamplighter station. There we will don our ceremonial lamplighter garb and help light the playa. Carrying kerosene lanterns,  Scouts will being doing more than providing a utility, Scouts will be performing a duty that is a symbol of participation in our community, and the magic of evening will be upon us (especially for the Black Rock Scouts because that evening we are going on Night Art Tour!). 

About Lamplighters: 

The Lamplighting ritual at Burning Man is a quiet an essential part of the communal desert experience.  It creates a sense of a real city with street lamps and invokes an old tradition of lamplighting that contrasts nicely with the technical innovations of today. Check out this awesome blogpost to learn more about the history of lamplighting at Burning Man. 

Http://blog.burningman.com/2010/06metropol/lamplighting-ritualizing-	functional-necessity. 

The Lamplighters draw more than 100 participants every evening of the event. In 1993 there were a dozen lanterns; now there are nearly 1000 to lift onto the spires that line the Esplanade pathways to the Man. To accomplish this considerable task, they ask for your help, and this year, they are inviting Black Rock Scouts and their parents to be a part of this community, this event, and their tradition. By the time the event ends, more than 1000 people will have helped the Lamplighters accomplish their important work.</p>

When scouts arrive at Media Mecca, they will be greeted by Media Team volunteers. Each scout will receive both a laminated scout-specific media tag which is attached to their cameras and a matching laminate to be worn around their necks. Once scouts have been inducted to the sacred alter of Free Press, scouts will take part in a short 45 to 60 minute presentation by Media Mecca photographer and blogger, John Curley.  Scouts will learn how best to capture photographs on the playa and how to vision their story when they set out for the proceeding Art Tour. After the Art Tour, Black Rock Scout leaders will collect your digital images and they will be memorialized in print by Saturday. 

About Media Mecca:

The Media Team is composed of a daring, dedicated, professional, fun-loving and largely well-behaved set of volunteers. Since 1997, their motley group of journalists, marketers, flacks, sociologists, technical writers, filmmakers, artists, anthropologists, IT professionals, art experts, budding rock stars, freaks, geeks, and ne'erdowells have helped members of the media plug in to the event, participate, and hopefully come away with a good story.</p>

Scouts and their parents will put the camera skills they learned from Media Mecca to good use on the art tour hosted by the Artery. The Artery will provide us two Mutant Vehicles, two guides and two navigators to take 25 to 40 people on a tour through art installations throughout the playa. Scouts will disembark and physically explore the installations. Scouts will also take photos that will later be gathered into a publication that will be available at the Black Rock Scout’s headquarters at the end of the burn. 



About The Artery:

The mission of the ARTery is to serve and defend artistic expression at Burning Man. The goal of the Artery is as an artistic resource center that facilitates the placement and display of art on the playa during the Burning Man Event. Their efforts are year round as they read through art applications, help artists through the installation process, keep records on art that has been and will be, so participants can be inspired again and again.</p>

The Gate Bus will pick you and your scout up inside Kidsville.  You will be greeted by Yando, a1950s Greyhound bus driver, and Zed, his flight attendant. Yando and Zed will tell you all about the Gate as you drive out Gate Road.  Safety is number 1 with the Gate crew and if the weather and the traffic conditions are right, you and your scout will find yourselves searching cars for stowaways and other contraband (dogs, fireworks and  MOOP Makers) in incoming vehicles.  If the conditions are not safe, don’t worry because the Gate crew always has shelter and something fun up their sleeves. 

About Gate: 

Gate processes all the arriving cars and tears your burning man ticket. We are the dusty people who search every car, truck, and RV looking for things that create MOOP and other things that are not allowed.

Perimeter is the force in the desert that keeps a keen lookout for people who are lost.

Exodus is the team that you see when you leave burning man. We are the line between here and there. We are the hard edge. We are the last stop before and after bliss. We are the dust.

We are all three departments all rolled up into one, we are the GATE... and we can't wait to meet you kids!</p>

The Death Guild is graciously hosting a Thunderdome match at the BIG Thunderdome on the playa, especially for teens aged 10 to 17. Scouts and their parents will meet at kidsville and bike to the Thunderdome (or be driven if a vehicle is available). Participants will be matched up with an opponent of equal size and weight and will be taken on a first come-first served basis. ALL participants must have a parent or guardian present to fight. Although safety padding and padded weapons are used, there is a risk of injury so participants fight at their own risk. Families and kids of all ages are invited to come watch the match.  

About Death Guild: 

Death Guild is one of  the oldest continually operating gothic/industrial dance club in the United States. The Death Guild crew is responsible for the construction and operation of Thunderdome, which has been very popular attraction at Burning Man since the mid 1990s.</p>

When burners arrive at the Greeters Station, they are warmly greeted with hugs, maps, information and a chance to ring the bell (if virgins). Scouts will be assigned two lanes at the Greeters Station where scout/parent teams will be trained and partnered up with other BRS teams. Teams may also be Traffic Rangers, directing cars in with the orange batons. 

Because we are dealing with moving cars, this event is recommended for Scouts age 6 and up, with a parent of course. There are potties and a shaded lounge at Greeters. 

Bring water, gum for dry throats, lip balm, snacks, a sun hat and some fun! Wear your BRS bandanas and patches! Scouts will be picked up and returned to Kidsville via art car.

About Greeters:

Greeters make the first impression when burners come home. Greeting is a vital role that helps shape and form the initial perceptions and expectations of first time participants. Greeting is the one and only chance to communicate with each and every participant on a one-on-one basis, mano-a-mano, facia-a-facia.

Armed with wit, wisdom and infectious exuberance, Greeters take advantage of this opportunity by becoming skilled information providers conducting helpful, informational workshops to carloads of people.</p>

About Emergency Services Department: 

Black Rock City's Emergency Services Department (ESD) is there when you need them months before the event officially starts, and are on-duty well after the last participant leaves to support the playa clean-up efforts. ESD provides Black Rock City with several different key areas of service; these services include Fire Fighting, Rescue, Hazardous Materials, Emergency and Non-Emergency Medical evaluation and treatment, Mental Health services (including sexual assault response), 911 Dispatch, and providing the two-way radio communications infrastructure for all of Black Rock City.</p>

	You and your scout will be picked up by an art car and enjoy an interesting ride over to the Department of Mutant Vehicles (DMV).  The DMV is a very short drive from Kidsville. On the way JJ of the DMV will explain the criteria for “creating” a Mutant Vehicle and point out interesting types of vehicles we pass along the way. At the DMV you and your scout will meet the DMV team (called “the DMV Hotties”) and help the Hotties inspect some vehicles. On the ride back we will all decide which inspected vehicle is worthy of the kids Choice Award for best mutant vehicle. JJ will return scouts and their parents to Kidsville at about 12:00 noon. 

About the Department of Mutant Vehicles and DMV Hotties


The Black Rock City Department of Mutant Vehicles licenses motorized mobile works of creative expression otherwise known as Mutant Vehicles. 

A crew of DMV Hotties work there day and night to ensure that all vehicles pass safety and creativity standards. The DMV Hotties perform a variety of tasks on and off playa including on-line pre-registration processing, and on playa inspection, licensing and processing of Mutant Vehicles.</p>

Every year, thousands of bunnies run rampant during the Billion Bunny March.  Animal Control diligently and humanely captures, vaccinates and tags bunnies, kitties and other wild animals during the March. Scouts and their parents will be trained on how to safely catch animal-human hybrids and will put their training to use at the Billion Bunny. 

Scouts meet at BRS in Kidsville and should bring a blank red T-shirt to make into an Animal Control uniform. Bring a large fish net on a pole and carrots on a fishing pole (bunnies can’t resist). Scouts will walk to the meeting place on the playa, where training will take place on just before Billion Bunny. 


About Animal Control: 

Since 2001, Black Rock City Animal Control (BRCAC) has tagged and inoculated countless playa animals. Safety and security from wild and rabid animals are our promises to you. BRCAC also continues to act out all over playa with playful shticks you're come to love such as Pit Crew, Chapstick Commandos,  Bad Idea Camp, and our quest to find the "Winner" of Burning Man with Trophy Camp.</p>

About Earth Guardians:

Earth Guardians inspire the Burning Man community to embrace Leave No Trace (LNT) principles and practices. They also visit the Black Rock desert outside of the Burning Man event both to introduce participants to the beauty of the area and to participate in restoration and education activities.</p>

 In 2011 Black Rock Scouts and Kidsville visited the Pier as part of the Art Tour, and the Pier was selected as "Kids Choice Award" for best Art installation. In 2012 we have planned visits to the Pier 2.0 on Tuesday during the Night Art Tour, and possibly on Wednesday during the Day Art Tour, but these two visits will only be appetizers before the Main Pier 2.0 Event. Friday will be a dedicated visit to Pier 2.0 and at the end of the pier, there will be a Spanish Galleon shipwreck we can all explore. Transportation will be in large fanciful ships, boats, and vessels. The Pier crew will meet us in pirate garb and speak and provide us our own personal tour. We will be climbing through the Spanish galleon wreck and search for clues to the occupants. Michelle, a member of the Pier’s building crew (and an burner parent) will be hosting the event and explaining the artifacts.

About Pier 2.0


Pier 2 is a magnification of Pier 1 in 2011. This is the second chapter in the life of a beloved piece of art. The stage for serendipity is now a launching pad for a grand tale as told through the remnants of a dead ship. Their intention is to create a story out of our art. They are replacing the words with experience and the chapters with exploration. Pier 2 will consist of 2 components: The Pier and The Ship. You can read more about the Pier 2.0 on their facebook page here:

Danny of Dragon Smelters has a wealth of knowledge of both smelting and metalworking, and a history of coin currency. Scouts have the chance to make their own count out of recycled aluminum cans at Recycle Camp. 

This year Danny has invited the Black Rock Scouts to join him. This is a good time to collect cans from your neighborhood to bring to Recycle Camp. Scouts will meet at BRS headquarters and walk or drive to Recycle Camp at the back of Center Camp. 




About Dragon Smelters:


Transforming metal into art is their practice and passion. This is how they have participated in Burning Man for over a decade. Currency is an important aspect of any city around the world, since Dragon Smelters believe deeply that the Burning Man event is a place where gifting is the rule, the coin represents the theme of Fertility by creating a beautiful object from recycling so this keep sake can be exchanged as a token of positive energy between all participants.</p>

With "Ride the Wind" you lay back on an air mattress so that all you see is this VERY LARGE white fabric floating horizontally on the wind.  After a couple of minutes your mind with adopt the fabric as it's frame of reference and your body will gain the sensation of floating relative to the fabric.  Now explore the patterns the wind creates, and feel them flow through you.</p>

 some chilly snow in the desert!
	Every Afternoon Monday through Friday, from 1-3 you can come by our cool shade tent and chill out with a snow cone made just for you in the many flavors of Our choice. You may have any of the flavors we decide to give you, while the ice lasts.

	Over heated Kids may cut the line,(with Mom/Dad), and may ask for a Cone anytime in the day if they need it, providing we can find the ice for them.

	Need we say more?
No, But we can.
	We strive for the best and finest shaved ice snow to blend with the flavors and encapsulate them it a tasty cooling treat. We don't do Chunky snow!  There is a difference, and you'll know it as soon as your frozen treat melts gently on your Tongue releasing the sweet and/or sour bouquet to your waiting taste buds, refreshing you and cooling you while you enjoy the Art and other activities available in our camp. 
	Bring a new clean block of ice and you'll make friends for life and maybe get an extra treat too!
We do not do snow cups, or Bottles, because they are not a Snow Cone and there is a Difference!</p>

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by separating your your recyclables from any landfill trash. Then separate all your aluminum cans and bring them to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is "Open" and ready to accept your cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We also do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!</p>

This is the device that sparked the fire of modern experimental particle physics by allowing the pioneers of the science to provide evidence for the existence of particles that resulted from nuclear decay processes. The particles from the cosmos above shower the playa every second of every day and now you too can see them with your naked eye. Bring your cameras and try and snag a shot to take back with you!</p>

        <p class="description">Welcome Bakers, Builders and Hi Gluten Fans!

In the Black Rock City tradition of emergency and experimental shelter, the world’s first building made of 805 bread loaf bricks is being constructed at the Skinny Kitty Tea Lounge camp. ( please fill in location as we have not been assigned a space yet)

We finally found a solid use for white bread; it’s the perfect building block. If you’ve ever wondered about the compressive strength of a 10 day old loaf, make a point to come by and marvel at this free-standing enclosed structure. The material for this abode can be grown in one growing season and has an insulation value of R-5. The inspiration for this 10 foot diameter Dome of Dough is the traditional beehive shape of the charcoal kilns in Death Valley.

Crawl inside, wonder at the meditative vibe and who knows, maybe there will be fresh bread and jam for snacking.

Come in your most outrageous costume, bribe the host, have that random item we call out for and you could find yourself on stage competing with another contestant for what is in the box! However, not every prize is so great, oh yes there are zonks out there so choose wisely and listen to your fellow citizens shouting from the audience because they may think they know something that you don’t. If you’ve seen the popular television show that inspired this game show then you know what to expect. Have fun, participate, and stick the zonk to the other guy! The main stage is located in the Mister Cool camp area.</p>

In a studio setting, using professional studio equipment you are photographed and preserved as you were during this life changing event.
Each person photographed is given a print as a tangible and permanent reminder of their time at Burning Man.
Sometimes you are directed, sometimes not.  This is your experience and I try to make it a lasting memory of your time here.
Individuals, groups, families (in all permutations) are welcome.
I usually begin in the mid to late morning and continue photographing till the late night.  Or until I can no longer stand and photograph.
So come early in the week, bring your friends and enjoy the rather unique experience of really being photographed.  It is not something to be missed.</p>

        <p class="description">Debris is an interactive, collaborative installation which is being created as a response to the problems presented by single use plastic.

The work reflects the literal problem of plastic in marine environments while offering a symbolic representation of the chemical body burdens carried by wildlife and humans alike. In presenting these issues, we are asked to consider misplaced notions of “disposability”, calling in to question consumer driven waste which has devalued what is in fact a very important material.

Participate: Make a Fish

Explore the Marine Food Web by drawing or painting a marine creature. A large array of fish, crustaceans, birds and mammals all make up the web and are all affected by chemical body burdens represented here by plastic. Think of how you can incorporate re-purposed material into your creature. This way, we can make use of that which is normally disposed of without second thought.

Send a .jpg of your piece to gallery420@gmail.com.
In doing so, you will be releasing your creature into the “ocean”.

 

The images are transferred onto repurposed materials like foamcore and are used as the base of interactive installations.These installations are set up in educational institutions and gallery exhibitions. Through the installation, people may learn about how we contribute directly to this problem, even if we live inland, and how we are directly impacted through the chemical body burdens we carry. Participants are introduced to solutions on how to reduce exposure to chemicals in their own lives and how to lessen the environmental impacts from the source.
Similar to the processing of material in the actual ocean, images will be replicated, transferred, redistributed, distressed, and reworked as the instillation is plugged into educational programming and handled by participants.

We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!</p>

        <p class="description">A writing marathon is a magical experience for anyone who loves to write, and the playa and BRC provide a wealth of imaginative material. This model was based on Natalie Goldberg's concept in "Writing Down the Bones," and developed into a moving art form by the Southeastern Louisiana Writing Project. In brief: we choose a location, sit and write for ten minutes or so, share what we have written, and move on to another location. The only response we give to each others' writing is "thank you." 
We will likely depart from the Midway around 3:50 after we get ourselves organized and sit down to "write out the cobwebs." Participate for as long as you wish. Depending on interest, we may even publish our work online after the event. Visit writingmarathon.com to get a taste of how we do this in the Big Easy!</p>

If you’ve seen the popular television show that inspired this game show then you know what to expect. Have fun, participate, and stick the zonk to the other guy!</p>

Do you want to reduce the amount of recycling you will have to pack out? Start by bringing all of your beverages in aluminum cans. Follow that by separating your your aluminum cans and other recyclables from any landfill trash. Bring your aluminum cans to Black Rock City Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is "Open" and ready to accept your aluminum cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. You can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and Black Rock City..!!!</p>

 The idea of the giant table refers of Gullivers travel to Brobdingnag - the country of the Giants. In contrast to the huge table set, we will serve tiny food suprises.
Food is one of most obvious things we enjoy or miss while travelling to foreign countries. To taste something unknown, you have to be open, brave and curious. Missing food from home makes us treasure, what we have in everyday life.
By serving very tiny suprises most people never tasted before, we want to create a very special, emotional and reflective moment for our guests.</p>

We'll cover several different topics and have interactive stations staffed with CMGC engineers and mentors! Given the breadth of ages, we'll do our best to cover as many age groups as we can with our science stations. We'll also be screen printing a custom Science+Kids+CMGC graphic! Bring over a shirt or other material to receive the print! (cotton/poly blend is good and it needs to be fairly clean) Parents, come over and take a seat. We'll chat with the kiddos for a while so have a refreshing adult beverage, relax for a bit, and get to know your friendly CMGC crew. (psss... we have a lot of adult oriented events as well, come back at 4 pm!) We're commonly found in the 7:45ish area between B-D, but be sure to check the camp placement roster before heading over.</p>

Impart, enjoy our art, be apart, and open your hearts;

Black Rock heaven gifting will be 24-seven;

Don’t be squirrely, here it’s never too late or too early;

Home, free from danger, leave some presents for a stranger;

Happily help yourself to a gift for you, because we love you too.

Come anytime and bring some things while remembering;

Anything that does not go, to and fro, into the trash we must throw;

A note of thanks for thoughtful presents yet, may the truest gift be your presence.

        <p class="description">Do you like Burning Man?  Do you like shiny lights?  Do you like play-doh?  We thought so.  This year, the NY Regional is combining all three, for the ultimate Midway interactive art trifecta at Burning Man.  

Each visitor to the Mad Sorcerer's Workshop creates one tiny clay creature and adds it to the world growing on the shelves of an infinity box.  Visitors are encouraged to interact with each other, to cooperate, and to let their imaginations roam, molding polka dot trees, green cows, castles, dinosaurs, and UFOs.  Make a blue fish, your friend can make a red bird, the next person will make a small man, together we'll have the beginnings of a whole new world, with the reflections of the infinity box making it look like there's whole schools and flocks of strange creatures and a crowd of people, all interacting.

You get to be the Mad Sorcerer, create whole worlds in your crystal ball, just to mess with them.  You get to say how creative and lovely your pet world will be.  There's no skill required, no creation too boring or too creative.  A red, and yellow and purple castle?  Yes!  A small brown snake?  Yes!  Every play-doh creature has a place with us.

Want to see how the project is going?  Want to Contribute and Volunteer? Like us at https://www.facebook.com/Mad-Sorcerer-1698581610391522/ for project updates and event announcements. 

Open 24-7, for kids of all ages, shade, play-doh and infinity box worlds provided.</p>

        <p class="description">Making drinking plans for your camp? Do those plans include lots and lots of cans? Want to unload those empty cans on playa while also helping the city of Gerlach? Well come on down to Recycle Camp and SHOW US YOUR CANS!!!  At Recycle Camp we want all of your ALUMINUM cans as part of our gift to the playa. We are located at 6 and Center Circle behind the Center Camp Cafe and will be open every day until 5pm. No drop offs allowed, when you get there you will help us quickly separate your cans before riding the Crushinator, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus, to compact the cans so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from can recycling is donated to the Gerlach school system. We only accept aluminum cans so please keep all of your soup or heavy metal cans. If you are unsure if it is aluminum a good rule of thumb is if you can't crush it, then we don't want it. Also, some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove of be conscious of it before bringing them to us. PROTIP from the Recyclenauts: bring a MESH bag to store all of your cans in. Plastic bags won't allow your cans to dry out, so please store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp and help make things a little less juicy for us when we crush them. Be smart, plan ahead, Recycle Camp wants YOU to come CRUSH it with us!!! We are CLOSED ON MONDAY, plan ahead!</p>
