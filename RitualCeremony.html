Through chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo an individual is able to awaken this enlightenment the Buddha revealed and reveal their own buddha nature. A practitioner of this buddhism through chanting and study can transform their life and create a state of unshakable happiness overcoming the sufferings of birth and death. Buddhism is a practice and everyone is welcome to join. Each day after chanting together we will study a buddhist concept, answer questions and share experiences about the practice and its application to our daily life. All are welcome to join us even if you have never chanted before.</p>

Throughout the '09-'10 BM year, the Ema has appeared at numerous BM & community events, underground parties and fundraisers. Ema contributions from this past year will be incorporated as part of this year's installation on playa & after combined with the new Emas created by the denizens of our BRC in 2010, will again be sacrificed at the temple burn. 

All are encouraged to come & seek or share enlightenment, as well as support the production, care and ceremonies that will be undertaken this BM'10. Do please visit, reflect and if inspired, contribute by adding UR creation.</p>

Held between Esplanade and the Man in empty playa (in line with 4:30), concentric rings of participants consciously come together to form circles with similar sound, such as drummers, chanters, clappers, singers, a band, or whatever. The gong is in the center and begins the flow outward as we all express our uniqueness and togetherness in community.

After we assemble, the gong will play for 5 minutes, then each ring of participants will make joyful sound for 5 minutes in a wave toward the outer ring and back again.

We have the gong, but the mandala depends on YOU to participate. It will appear at 3:00 pm on Thursday and disappear at 4:30.</p>

***WE ASK EVERYONE TO WEAR WHITE***

We will be meeting at the Rooftop Camp (AKA "Animus") in NYrvana village at approximately 5:30pm on Thursday September 2nd. There will be two waves of a procession leaving about 6pm going out to the Temple where the ceremony will be. The men will leave first and the women a few minutes later. (So as not to reveal the bride to the groom too soon).

The ceremony will take place at the Temple hopefully around 6:30pm.

If anyone would like to do anything special during the ceremony please let us know.

Afterward we will be heading to an as yet determined camp (maybe Kostume Kult?) for the afterparty. We'd love to have everyone there to share our joy and some surprises and hopefully bring out all of your best performance skills and talents to help create a magical evening!

THE BACHELOR/BACHELORETTE PARTY:

Will be Tuesday night, August 31st. We'll probably start at Rooftop Camp for drinks then head out and find some sexy places to party, but nothing is certain yet. We just hope all of you will come out for some delicious debauchery and fun and get us into lots of trouble before we tie the knot. More details when we get them.


OTHER EVENTS:

We will be doing some last minute crafting and preparations during the week before the ceremony, especially Wednesday at Rooftop Camp, so feel free to check in with us if you'd like to lend a hand and some artistic skills.

**ALSO**!!!!!

*Is anyone not planning on arriving at Burning Man until Tuesday or Wednesday or even Thursday? If so, we have a very special, very important mission for you if you'd like to accept it! Please let us know!

Many many X's and O's,
-Carolina & Matthew</p>

        <p class="description">In the Burning Man spirit of love and celebration, the Lollipop Guild will perform non-binding Playa weddings for you and yours; embracing diversity and encouraging creativity.

It is our goal to present these weddings as a celebration of love while embracing the moment and enjoying life!  Our unions are a quasi-political statement noting that diversity in love is as unique as the individuals involved and that happiness is a right for everyone.  We encourage you to embrace what moves you and enjoy your very own OUTrageous ceremony!

Your special bonding ceremony will be complete with classic attire options,
music, guests, decorations and digital photography.  Or add your own personal
touch by wearing your favorite outfit or nothing at all.  Bring your in-laws,
your camp-mates, or your brand new friends.   Walk away with a personalized
certificate to commemorate this extraordinary event and the digital photos that are taken of you will be made available online soon after Burning Man.

Multiple people or objects may be joined together in one playa union. Feel free to marry your loving partner, your trick from last night, your sexual enhancement apparatus, your favorite vegetable, your best friend or your 3 best friends.  It's all good!

Weddings will be performed in the Lollipop Guild Chapel Tuesday through Friday between the hours of 3:00pm and 5:00pm.  Then, on Friday from 5:00pm until 7:00pm, be sure to join us as we host a mass wedding reception for all of
those who have participated in the weddings.  Cocktails will be provided.  We hope to see you there!</p>

"Where have you been?", "Where are you going?", "Where Are You Now?"

The invitation to passersby over the week will be to write on the cube their answers. At the end of the week, covered in answers, inspirations, observations, and sensations, the miniature temple to transitions will be immolated on its own sacred pyre.

Write on it during the week, then, after the man burns, come to Guangzhou & 7:20 and join us in a festive  torch-lit procession accompanied by musicians, fire-dancers, and drummers, by mythical characters, soldiers, and pallbearers in golden robes who, en masse, will lift the structure in its decorated entirety and carry it to its appointed pyre on the inner playa. The Threshold of Heat and Light will die in flames and thus cross its own Threshold and carry with its cremation the reins that will pull the hundreds who have written on its walls across the lines of their own Thresholds standing between Where They Have Been and Where They Are Going. In the transcendent fire their intentions will create their futures.</p>

        <p class="description">All women and girls: Embody freedom lost and found. Sing, drum, and dance a body prayer home to yourself, your sisters and your wild heart.  

This year, once again, the Critical Tits Ride will lead to a Women's Only Ritual on the open playa.  

Bike Parking Gods will usher all female, or identifying as female, riders into the bike parking area. From there, enter the Ritual on foot, passing through the Serenading Portals of the Acaplaya Choir, into the Ritual Ring. All are invited to join their voices with the choir and welcome their sisters into the Ritual Ring.

The circumference of the Ring is held by the bodies of our Sacred Space Holders - facing outward towards the open playa to engage looky loos asking them to respect the event and lower the cameras.  Along the circumference, at each of the cardinal points - East/Child, South/Maiden, West/Warrior Mother, North/Crone - are our Drummers, grounding our spirits while enticing our bodies to fly.  Our Nipple Card Goddesses will again offer CT Nipple cards as well as ribbons on which to write prayers to be tied to the circumference of the Ritual Ring. The ribbons will later be taken to the temple to burn.

As the ritual reaches a critical mass of tits, one of our High Priestesses will begin the dancing body prayer - connecting us to our own wild hearts, those of our sisters' and out to that of the playa itself.

Not for spectators. We invite partners and friends to help hold the ritual space. We need volunteers for set up/clean up, bike parking, drumming and holding of the ritual space. If you want to get involved, contact us at info2010(at)criticaltits(dot)com.</p>

1) Wear as much or as little clothing as you want, no pressure either way.

2) No food, drinks, or drugs in the pool, unless there's enough for everybody and everybody wants some.

3) No bodily fluids in the pool. ...Unless there's enough for everybody and everybody wants some.

Makes a body feel alone.

        <p class="description">aka Women's Shakti empowerment 1 st Charkra temple Friday Sept 3, 2 to 4 PM. 
Many women seek the solace of the Sisterhood to help help empower and reclaim their sacred feminine wounded from male violation. 

While useful in diminishing shame and guilt, women sometimes fuel the "righteous" rage and distrust for the male energy as well. Power at the expense of your innermost yearnings.

If you had an awful relationship with your Father, could your loving mother and sisters ever give you more than a band-aid for this wound to your feminine Spirit

How likely is it that holding soft kittens will ever heal you from a fear of Dogs after being severely mauled.

In this ceremony, 2 or 3 women will be selected as surrogates for the other participants. They will be transported into an ecstatic bliss and utter rapture that will eclipse the usual, more directly sexual Tantric offerings as this work awakens your deepest sexual goddess but does not "tamper" with you.

All women are beautiful and sacred temples. They are the bearers of LIFE and are complete in ways that 'Testosterone poisoned' men can never be. Men manifest in the world by by force of will & external action whereas Women actually manifest the world. I hold women sacrosanct.

Here are some testimonials. I hope from these alone that you will trust your intuition and receive Divine masculine flow as atonement for all the men who have abandoned, wounded, violated and trespassed against your sacred, sensual, sexual feminine Spirit in any manner.
here is a common experience of the work.

... ... I can recall the state I found myself in while you were working on me. It allows me to return to that
place of consciousness where everything is allowed, nothing is resisted and the
deep longing I feel meets desire in every other molecule around me. Under your
touch there was hardly a you and a me.
There was just an experience of a fundamental vibration of Love</p>

..My friend is in a coma she had a major heart attack and major stroke she has no brain function and her kidneys have failed and her body slowly shutting down and she has a 5 year old son no one knows what has caused this she has been in a coma 2 weeks now 

Megan Read June 13 at 2:58am 
Hey thanks for ur healing energy for my friend.  A miracle happened this week. She woke up from her coma. The doctors said her organs had all shut down. She was brain dead and there was no hope of her waking up. But she woke up with no memory loss and the doctors can’t find much wrong with her.  She is up eating, talking, walking, doing everything natural. It’s a miracle! Doctors are amazed & so are every one of her friends and family 


Tentative location for the Temple of Touch and the Altar of Mercy will be with Sacred Spaces Villages or Entheon village, but we are open to any hosting with a 10x20 

The Whimsical Mystic shared his work at Burning Man, Bhakti-fest, Symbiosis, EarthDance, Water Woman world and the International Alchemy Conference just last year - and never turns anyone in need away who can not afford to pay- even outside of burning man

Offerings include Awakening the Sacred Feminine workshops,Allness Blessings, healings,.

Let's all walk down the aisle to celebrate Joselynn Planks engagement to Randy Engstrom ( Undisputed, 2009 Mayor of Black Rock City) in a 100 bride march to the Man. Wednesday Night at Burningman all Brides (that means YOU and YOU yes...we really do mean YOU) Show up at our camp (RAIR) 4:30 & B to walk the Aisle to THE MAN. A sweet remix of the wedding march will play behind the treehugger/puking unicorn bus courtesy of DJ Whatever. Join us for a Champagne toast to the Bride, words of inspiration from the Reverend Thomasutra and a night of rock n' roll in bride regalia.

Come march cause you believe in love or cause you want to believe in love! Come march cause you already have a dress or you would love to have a dress! Come march cause this is your big break to bride up without all the family drama! Come march cause it was so much fun (or not) when you did it the first time. Come and MARCH cause you might never do it or do it again. Come for Joselynn. Come for yourself. Come for fun. Come to be serious. Come to be silly. JUST COME.

Who: YOU!
What: 100 Brides march for the Bacharette Party of Joselynn Plank
Where: Wed night - Burningman 2010 - Return of Arson Island Resort (RAIR) 4:30 & B
When: When the sun hits the mountain
How: Get yourself a wedding dress (in any state of repair or disarray) and show up to join the fun

Now get out there and start looking for your dress. Men & Women are all invited as long as they bride up!</p>

The scarab is an ancient symbol used to reflect eternity and the never-ending cycle of life.  In terms of the Metropolis, let us not drift too far from our roots in the natural world and instead remain tied to the rhythm of change of the hour, season, years, etc...  At this year's Burning Man Experience, we will utilize the Scarab as a focal point for choreographed performance and spontaneous musical creations.  Please join us for the unfolding for each sunrise at the Camp of the Rising Sun!</p>

        <p class="description">The Sun Lodge is a ceremonial gathering modeled after council meetings of the Native American Talking Stick tradition.  Each man in the circle, while holding the stick, has the power of words--a chance to fully express himself and be heard in a sacred and impartial container.  The speaker is supported in the courageous act of speaking in the true voice without need of defenses, without interruption.  The rest of the members listen in quiet and deepening wisdom, hearing the synergistic echoing of brothers' voices.  We hear in these interwoven narratives, our own realities echoed and amplified, rendered in greater and more nuanced clarity.  In expressing ourselves within the tipi, while connected to the earth, the elements and the four directions, we access the codes of our authentic selves.  The circle is blessed with sacred smoke and instruments and and it is closed with the intention of a better life for all of those who have gathered.</p>

Something deep and profound happens in consciously choosing to step into transformation. Choosing a ceremonial Rite of Passage is a gateway into understanding ourselves, our life journey, and our place within our communal ecosystem. Without Rites of Passages in our culture we lose the bond of community connection forged through witnessing and supporting one another on our journeys. Learn about the four stages of initiation and transformation, what stage you currently are at in your cycle, and the tools that can assist you at that stage. You will then be led in a practice to gain clarity on your destiny path and the intended gift you are to bring to serve the greater community. This workshop combines practices from many lineages of Rites of Passages, including Tibetan Buddhism, the Q’ero Shamans of the Andes, and modern Wilderness Therapy.


Shena is a Transformation Coach, Ecotherapist, Shamanic Counselor, and Rites of Passage Guide. She has been initiated by Rites of Passages into several lineages including the Q’ero Shamans of Peru and Tibetan Buddhism, and is a Certified Wilderness Vision Quest Guide and Rites of Passage facilitator. She was passed the Ritesof the Munay Qi from the Shamanic lineage and learned to weave earth medicine into energetic and psychological healing on the individual and community levels. 
She has experience guiding others through a variety of Rites of Passages, including 10 day Vision Quests which involve fasting in the wilderness for both adolescents and adults, as well as weekend Rites of Passage workshops for both men's and women's groups.

Shena is the Co-Founder of Sacred Living Institute (www.sacredlivinginstitute.com), an organization dedicated to awakening and embodiment of the soul self through Rites of Passages, Wilderness Therapy, and Contemplative Practice. She is also the Co-Founder of Critical Beats for the Climate, a non-profit that serves the people of the Amazon.</p>

Appreciate the indigenous stillness and aesthetics of the Black Rock
desert in a cordoned-off zone free of motorized vehicles and loud
amplified music. The Otic Oasis is a wilderness outpost providing an
audio antidote and alternative of peace and quiet. The Otic Oasis will
be the first structure in this wilderness area in Black Rock
City, where no motorized vehicles are permitted and large scale sound
systems don’t penetrate – deep in walk-in camping. At last, a retreat
where the aural options are in keeping with the indigenous stillness
and aesthetics of the Black Rock Desert. It will provide shade and
shelter to weary travelers who might require a bit of tranquility and
quiet in order to recharge and allow them to commune with their
internal and external environments. The Otic Oasis is a 35-foot
geometric crystalline cluster structure of interwoven modules that
provides individualized and group spaces for meditation and
contemplation of the sunrise, sunset and our natural surroundings. The
biomimicry of the design complements the desert backdrop and offers a
manmade structure that takes inspiration from the rocks, mountains,
caves, and plateaus found in nature. It is made completely of
interlocking wood, with no nails or metal fasteners and, in keeping
with the parameters of this zone, was hand-carted to its location and
erected without the use of any motorized vehicle or heavy equipment.</p>

        <p class="description">The Soul of the Temple is the Gamelatron, an orchestra of antique gongs used in balinese temple ceremonies outfitted with robotic counterparts.

The traditional instruments that are played robotically in the Gamelatron are authentic gongs that were used in temple ceremonies in Bali for decades before they came to the United States. This authenticity contributes an energy of spiritual legitimacy to the project. The 5-tone tuning system of the gongs reflects the 5 cardinal directions of the universe (North, South, East, West and Center). When they are rung they conjure the god energies of the greater universe into the space. Gamelan music in Bali is often present in temples as part the spiritual practice of making and purifying offerings for the Gods.

The instruments the Gamelatron will use are from the traditional ensemble known as Beleganjur. Beleganjur is most commonly used in ceremonies to accompany the body of the dead to its pyre. The music purifies the space around the body, scaring off the evil spirits that would stray the soul from its destiny to be released in fire. The temple at Burningman is destine to burn, and with it the release of prayers and intentions of an entire community. The songs of the Gamelatron foster an alchemic transformation of these prayers and intentions while creating a sacred space to the temple grounds.</p>

It's not very often that we get to meet Geocachers from all over the place in our neck of the woods.  What could be better than on a dusty playa in the Nevada desert? I can't think of anywhere I'd much rather be?
At least a couple of us will be wearing tie dyed T-shirts with Great Basin Eastern Sierra Geocachers in large white writing on the back.  We plan on meeting at the MAN for our annual group photo, trade travelbugs, pass out some schwag, and share our playa/geocaching stories.  Then...those that would like to join us, we'll be touring the C.O.R.E effigies as a group. As always, bring enough refreshments to keep yourself hydrated!</p>

In our day and age it is normal and often assumed that all baby boys are to be circumcised. Circumcision in our culture is thrust on the baby before he is given a chance to choose this irreversible physical change. 
This one day event is an opportunity to choose and be completely aware of your rite of passage. Whether you have foreskin or not, all are welcome. Women are welcome to be a part of the ceremony as well.
The goal is to have a number of participants gather. Everyone has a chance to voice their personal feelings surrounding the subject of circumcision. (For example, any feelings of loss, resentment, thankfulness, hugeness, smallness, pain, joy, etc.) 
The goal is to reach a universal sense of awareness and for every man to be complete in himself whether cut or uncut. 
After the discussion, the foreskin awareness ceremony begins: (privately or publicly, his/her choice on an individual basis) the prosthetic foreskin will be introduced to the penis.
       A moment of recognition is experienced. (Can include but is not limited to incense, fanning with palm fronds, tears, prayers, chanting.) 
	The prosthetic foreskin is then painlessly peeled away, by choice and in full awareness.
	Each person gets to keep his/her own foreskin as a memento in an egg necklace.</p>

        <p class="description">Today's culture has mostly forgotten the value of rites of passage in general and specifically, menstruation. This gateway is a valuable moment in a woman's life, which when neglected can potentially bring forth self-created initiations which can actually endanger a woman's sense of self and bring forth greater problems for her and her community. Some examples of self-created initiations are teen pregnancy, overuse of alcohol and drugs, joining cults, and more. 

The purpose of a rite of passage is to acknowledge a great shift in one's life journey. These happen at times such as, birth, marriage, death, moving cities/states/countries, etc. Our society has created ceremonies or rituals for these occassions: weddings, funerals, barmitzfas (spelling?) so why not the entering of womNhood, a woman's first blood? And the men are even worse off with no formal introduction or method by which to acknowledge their entry into manhood. Again causing similar non-beneficial initiations. 

So what is the big deal or rite of passage that menstruation offers?  Simply put, it is the moment when a woman's spirit is anchored into her physical body to ground her into the earth reality. Not so simple maybe. We honor the girl's transition in ceremony with her community to welcome the fullness of who she us and who she is becoming. The strength of her community assists her in having the courage to stand fully in her body, spirit, heart and mind as one being. From this place, she can mature and grow into a woman who is rooted and supported. 

I have invited men to participate in this ritual because I believe the new age calls for gender alchemy which is harmony between the sexes. Men are called to stand as witnesses, pillars of support and compassionate listeners. We are one in the human family and shall stand together in community.</p>

It is as secular or as meaningful as you decide - because it's art.  You will marry yourself (not someone else) in this quickie, Lost-Vegas parody of a western marriage ceremony, but cheaper. 

It's Non-denominational.   No need for a bride, groom, nor in-laws!. All you need is your body and soul.   

We offer bouquets to hold and rings and vows to keep.  We take your wedding photo and you can grab it off the website.  Pre-printed multiple choice vows can be used as inspiration  or you can check off the boxes.  A sample of the vows is on the site.

You may bring your own rings and vows.   It’s your wedding, after all.

Want the mini-exorcism/divorce from past selves? Just ask. 
it's on the form.  

We are happy to accommodate you as deep as you're willing to go.
It's your wedding.   Wear whatever makes you happy - costumes are welcome. It's your ceremony.   

Friends and Groups may attend at your discretion or you may go it in private.  It's your wedding.  

You can even take vows together, but you would not be marrying each other.  Each one to his-herself. 

It's kitschy and celebratory, but honestly, there is power in the vows. 

You fill out the form, add what you like to it, and when you're done realizing that you deserve as much love, support and discipline as you give and expect from others -  take it home as a personal contract. 
It's all you, baby. We're just here to encourage you.</p>

Dancing Freedom is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance practice supporting the emergence of living oneness and what it truly means to be embodied. It is fun, and empowering. Any person of any age, size, color or creed can do it. We explore the ways in which the 5 elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether may assist us in creating a deeper relationship to our Selves, others, and our environment. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work within us, we gain tools that help us to move through life and all of its lessons in a more centered and conscious manner. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community.
All one needs is the desire for health, vitality, happiness and a deeper connection to self and others. This is a free form movement practice that is safe for all abilities. It is a friendly entry point into movement as medicine and it’s a powerful addition to an existing yoga, meditation or healing practice.

As we revel, let us resonate so deeply with this experiment in community that we share the creations with Dreamers, Contemplators, Meditationists and those who believe in Imagining - anyone who can think Burning Man can join us in the experience as Creators.  

Those whose Rite it is to carry the passage as a Bridge to the World. 

For Those numbered 60,001+     

We'll meet in the music, in the dust and the mystery, in the fire and company of new friends, in the shared experience of life - inFuseMent - flooding this network with an awareness of our connection!  We welcome all travelers home!

THE STORY:
In 2002, I sent a piece of art intentionally to Burning Man - I couldn't go, but that year, and every year after, sent some piece of creation, in 2002, I sent a chalk drawing on wood with a Viking. That was the first year I remember dreaming of Burning Man.  

Although I had never been, I understood it to be a place of Art created in celebration of what it is to be fully unfurreled, in manifestation with high winds to carry you.

I was also beginning to more deeply study meditation and the dissolution of self.  I would not travel to Burning Man by person for another 6 years.  However, that year, by my dreams I began to travel to a place filled with light, creativity and vibration. Great fires (as in mythic-big!) and every human experience in outbursts of joy, anger, jubilation, fear, happiness, love - tears and laughter shouting and release - I began dreaming of Burning Man. 


It would be years between these dreams and when I got my first ticket and traveled to Burning Man, American Dreamer, 2008.

Recommended: study dream meditation, dream yoga and 'remote viewing'.  

This meditation is to strengthen the invitation to dreamers and other 'unseen beings' to join us in spirit as we celebrate creative culture wherever it is found.</p>

        <p class="description">Since 1979, the First Church of the Last Laugh, the world's oldest religion, the world's largest church, has sponsored the annual St Stupid's day parade held every April 1st in San Fransisco. St Stupid,is a little known saint,4'2'', patron saint of civilizations and parking meters, who manifests him/it self, unavoidably in the human DNA. To give homage to this universally shared glitch/flaw/feature, the FCLL  puts on a parade thru the SF financial district, on weekdays and thru North Beach on weekends. Lead by Bishop Joey, the weekday route stops at the various Stations of Stupid in its yearly attempt to exorcise the buisness of religion and the religion of buisness. The Taberknuckle of stupid will transplant some of these rituals to the playa in order to spread the stupid face and the stupid word...which is , oddly enough, 'stupid', to the dusty masses.If you're human your already in the church, along with 7 billion others. Come to the Taberknuckle to be 're-membered' thru the rites and lefts of the world's fastest growing 'snack-religion', 150% less dogma, its a lite religion, one hole-y day a year, and this aint it. A self guided re-membrance tour will be available at all hours and some minutes. The full tilt high production value entertainment extravaganza that is the HI MASS for the MASSES will be conducted by Bishop Joey and the deep phat friars every once in awhile after sunset. Come see the sistupid chapel ceiling of wonderment. Partake in the microphone of confessional shame and relief. Sign up for the 2 minute talent show.Get the tatoo. Find out where the tatoo removal office is. Do the LEAP of FAITH. Learn the secret handshake. Exchange socks!! Be exposed to the the teachings of the world's most dangerous religion...just for laughs. Find out how St Stupid operates in your life and how to channel his/her/its unavoidable inflluence to win the lottery of luck, love and liberation. Egalite/Fraternite/Absurdite. So far...so what. remember, don't forget...or ?</p>

Join us on this unforgettable tribal SOUL journey as we create a ritual celebration that fuses dance and contemporary shamanism. This unique form of movement therapy heals and frees physical, mental, emotional and spiritual blockages, blurring the lines between club culture, dance, music and internal exploration by tuning in to sound, movement, and the trance-like journey of self-discovery and self-realization! This mystical, inspirational and fun process modernizes ancient shamanic journeying techniques of drumming and the ritualistic use of the blindfold. With the Shamanic safe space set and a personal intention declared, you blindfold yourself to enter an individual experience of self-expression and inner awakening. The music brings you into yourself and encourages you to explore the unknown, the darkness where we transcend into deeper states of consciousness - where there is freedom to scream, cry, meditate, dance and everything in between -  with the available assistance of the leader and the gatekeepers. Throughout the dance, the leader may apply energetic healing by intuitively approaching dancers, but without the use of touch. Eventually the music brings us back home here on earth, and dancers relax upon the ground to receive hands on healing. Side by side, though in our own inner world, through this journey we each are given the chance to experiencing our sacred "Vision Quest". We dance our intention and seek to better understand our Soul's purpose. 

First-time gatekeepers encouraged to volunteer to help keep dancers safe during the dance - this is generally done energetically, though light touch may be used if necessary. All our welcome on this journey, however, you must be on time. This is  a respectful, safe and sacred event.</p>

        <p class="description">My name is Tex Allen and I wear a clown nose 90% of the time I'm outside of my home. Whythenose.com is dedicated to the act of wearing a clown nose everyday, in order to make people smile.

It’s here for YOU…to encourage you with an act of Heroic Uninhibited Innocence.
It’s really that simple. In a world filled with distractions and distrust, you’d be amazed at how many people have lost a sense of childlike wonder. Or maybe you wouldn’t…

In the year since WhyTheNose was launched on the Playa at Rites of Passage, the project has transformed not only me, but it's brought together thousands of people through the photos and videos I've created.

Wearing a clown nose is fun, it’s easy, and it’s free if you already have the nose. YOU CAN COME GRAB ONE AT CENTER CAMP CAFE AND OTHER LOCATIONS ALL WEEK AT BRC...I'm bringing 5000 :)

WhyTheNose is only here to show you how joyful it is to change someone’s day with a simple, silly act.
Trust me, the nose breaks through barriers and opens doors every time you wear it…give it a try!

When you wear it and you’re waiting with a kind word, a laugh, a validation that you’re NOT crazy, just happy?
MAN, that’s powerful powerful stuff!

Ultimately, one’s attitude, your inner light, your reason raison d’etre that can make a difference in people’s lives and it’s a simple as the nose on your face.

Be loving and see what happens!

The inclusion of the nose is what creates the dissonance and that slight shift in “reality” is very important..it can (gently) jar people enough to open that door, that opportunity in them for opening up and taking a chance, taking a little risk to interact with someone they don’t know..who has on a clown nose!?!

Find WhyTheNose at Center Camp Cafe all week and if you pick up a Nose, would you please wear it Wednesday? I want YOU to help me spread the joy and beauty and ethos of OUR community with this one act you take take home and use every day :)

Thank's for the love, sfTex</p>

        </div>
        <p class="description">This year, the UK Regional Burning Man Community is to create one of the largest collaborative art projects from this side of the pond. 

The 'Tower of Nowhere' is a 20-foot bell tower, and a physical manifestation of our virtual community. It represents our hopes, dreams, memories, life and death and eventually rebirth. The tower will be planned in the UK, and built from scratch in the Black Rock Desert.

The bell founding takes place on the Tuesday night, beside the Tower of Nowhere on the Playa. We will cast five bells, a large central one which hangs as the centrepiece and four others encircling this, hung on each support.

The bell casting is surrounded by ritual and theatre, with people being invited to gift jewellery (copper, brass, bronze, tin, zinc, gold, silver but not steel, titanium etc) to the molten metal, in order to become a part of the bells themselves. 

Imagine the atmosphere filled with chaos and fervour, anticipation and ritual, and a mesmerising display of traditional craftsmanship!

The grand finale sees the great reveal, as the crucible is lifted out of the fiery furnace, the blazing phosphorescent bronze liquid and glowing as it is poured into the bell mould.</p>

        <p class="description">As always, Morphous & ShiZaru and the full international and domestic TBE crew are oh so ready, willing and able to facilitate the very best in bassquakin' as loud & proud as needed, to generate a veritble TSUNAMI deluge of freeBASSin' for all the denizens of Black Rock City. 

In addition to the high quality audio ~WaVeS~ TBE is well known for in their event enhancement production, once again TBE will be bringing their official theme camp (the TSUNAMI BASS EXPERIENCE), which will serve as the location for TBE's multi-media, interactive art/sound installation: the ~WaVe~2.0 to BRC!

This revolutionary interactive installation was conceived, designed and created by ShiZaru.zoe & Andrew Morphous specifically for the application of BASS CULTURE APPRECIATION and EDUTAINMENT. The first ~WaVe~ Ver. 1 prototype debuted in NYC in Feb 2011 at the Funhaus technology fair with subsequent indoor, outdoor and mobile versions appearing at various art and bass culture events during the spring and summer throughout in the NYC area including the LOST HORIZONS NIGHT MARKET and the FIGMENT NYC 2011 and 2012 art festival on Governor's Island. 
If you have had the TSUNAMI BASS EXPERIENCE, then you know how it LOOKS, SOUNDS, and FEELS... 

The ~WaVe~ installation is capable of transducing the low end frequencies as low as 5 Hz, provides a sensory enhancement oft described as a "bassface inducing," but more importantly, taps directly into one's kinestetic learning/thinking modality. It is this, when combined with the proper audio and visual ~WaVeS~ for expontential enahancement, that sparks the intuitive, thereby facilitating proper BASS CULTURE APPRECIATION. 

So come on by and take a dip in the deluge, challenge your perceptions on the Tsunami Bass Experience's ~WaVe~2.0, custom built 'Body~Sonic' dance platforms that will rumble ur rectum and sooth your heart/mind with oh so fine low end frequency via proper BASS!!</p>

        <p class="description">Critical Tits- topless bike procession has been a life-changing tradition since 1996 and is an unforgettable high-point of the week for all women who want to have the experience of being celebrated as Goddesses,Sisters, Mothers, Daughters,or female members of the human race. The critical mass is thousands of women who proudly ride in this procession to create a wave of joy for themselves, each other, and the respectful bystanders who cheer them on their way.Please consider the privacy of the riders in this huge parade when tempted to take photos or videos without the women's permission.
Celebrate your creativity with artful decorations,glitter,paint,be yourself to the max! Fertility is the perfect theme to participate in this joyful event, or come out to the parade route and cheer the Goddesses on! 
An unforgettable, life-changing ritual is planned at the end of the ride, don't miss it. 

History of Critical Tits:
The ride started in 1996 on a day when the Critical Mass ride was taking place in San Francisco. Five of us painted our chests, got on our bikes and rode through BRC shouting “Critical Tits.” Women joined us and men bowed down. Each year since then the ride has more or less doubled in size. We had 5000+ riders in previous years.

Obviously something about the experience resonates with women. We are the largest gathering of women on the playa, and for many of us, the experience offers a meaningful connection to the power of female energy within ourselves and within our playa community.

Q: When is the ride?

A: The ride starts at 4 pm on Friday at the Man. Please respect the fact that the ride is for women and girls only.

Q: What happens at the end of the ride?

A: Each year, the ride ends in a different manner. The end-of-ride event is meant as an opportunity for women to connect with and celebrate each other.</p>

It is brought to each participant by the tautua'ava, or 'ava server, in the order proscribed by the tufa'ava, or 'ava distributor. Usually, the highest chief of the visiting party is served first, followed by the highest chief of the host party, and then service proceeds based on the rank of the rest of the participants. The drink is served in a polished coconut half. The overall ceremony is highly ritualized, with specific gestures and phrases to be used at various times.

Our Kava ceremony will be a first come first serve event if the turnout is too overwhelming! Hope to see you there!

        <p class="description">Dragun Giant Robot is the brainchild of Nick Myerhoff and Mike Parisi. They are a pair of misfit artist comrades who have been seeding the giant robot sculpture concept since 1995 when they worked together on the original Armymen video game at the now defunct 3DO Company. Nick was awarded the first Distrikt art grant in December 2011 and the robot grew in his back yard in Alameda over the ensuing months attracting a superstar build team: Mark Wagner, Ken Dahl, Daimon Marchant, Mike Parisi, Nick Myerhoff, Richard McDougall, Woodson Martin. The collective experience of the team ranges from Guinness Book of World Record art creators to silicon valley computer science executives and engineers.

Dragun is a 20’ tall full-scale stylized version of a 1970’s Shogun Warrior (known as Jumbo Machinder) made of recycled plastic. It is an interactive, large scale art sculpture with completely different night and day visual aesthetics. The robot is adorned with three types of interactivity; sound, light and movement. He is controlled by wifi, motion sensor and a cable pulley system. Many discussions have taken place around his gender and it is still unknown.

The robot is as tall as a house and weighs in at approximately 1000 lbs. His arms are made from Mango Chutney barrels and his legs are plastic water drums. Dragun's only metal part is his head, which is a wood burning stove. Dragun is made from 90% post consumer waste; he’s recycled! The robot took final shape in a single instant when Nick found the bright orange mail pallets (chest) and blue water barrels (legs) at the scrappy San Pablo salvage yard in Oakland late in 2011. 

Dragun will be on display at Distrikt camp from Monday August 27 through Monday September 3 at 9 o'clock and F, Black Rock desert. You are invited to attend a candle lighting ceremony on Monday August 27th at 9P.M. playa time. Come get a piece of him (plastic) in necklace form at the lighting.</p>

The "Life in 5 Words" project began in the desert of Black Rock City, at Burning Man 2010. 
A small wooden desk is built on the side of the road. It is guarded by the Tree of Life, a "palm" tree with leafy hands outstretched to the sky.  Inside there is the blank Book of Life. Anyone who opens this mysterious book is greeted with the question “What is the meaning of life?” The Catch: your answer has to be in 5 words, no more no less. 
Answers will be written within the book’s dusty pages throughout the week of Burning Man. Ravers, demons, and dusty pilgrims will stop to reflect and contribute their answers. It is a shared experience; anyone and everyone has access to the book.</p>

Gravity central.Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self.

Whether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utulize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.</p>

•	Come join us for a light heart-ed exploration of Qigong, an ancient book of wisdom written in the language of movement.  You'll discover that you have all the resources you need to keep your body healthy and your mind at peace, using these simple, yet profound movements.  Jump, tap, shake, sway, and breath yourself into a state of tranquility & health.  There will be an emphasis on practical application; this is a workshop and ritual, not a lecture! All are welcome, especially beginners.  Open yourself to the magic coursing within. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful complement to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanism.</p>

SCENARIO: AS RITUAL, WE DON’T PRE ANNOUNCE THIS.  participants enter the space and are immediately blindfolded and given earplugs to put in. we then gently lie them down in a circle, where they silently lay for a few minutes. at some point, someone begins to sprinkle dirt (earth) over them, to represent a burial. at some point, we gently have them rise (still blindfolded) and line them up, placing the hands of each person on the shoulders of the person in front of them. accompanied by drums, rattles, windchimes, flutes, etc. we walk them out to some chosen, semi-remote place on the playa. once there, we paint them with white paint (in ritual markings, not the whole body) and remove their blindfolds and ear plugs. we instruct them to embody various forms of development as we walk back to the original spot - first sliding over the earth, then crawling, then walking, and finally running. perhaps even dancing by the end. reaching our end, we break out into full celebration and incorporation, simultaneously mourning the person that has just died and celebrating the new person that has made the journey back with us.</p>

•	A playful exploration of love relationships as a spiritual practice.  Learn exercises to deepen trust & communications.  All couples welcome. 
All couples are invited to this playful exploration of intimate partnership and love as a spiritual practice and path to realization.   Harness the wisdom of the body and the physical sensations of love to deepen trust, strengthen communications, and create a powerful shared vision for your love relationship.   Discover ancient Yogic, Tantric, and Taoist exercises that will allow you to gain deep insight into your relationship and see your partner in a whole new light, whether you just met on the playa or renewing your vows on your 40th anniversary. You will experience your partner’s love and trust in a new and profound way. Learn how to use these powerful skills and movements to create a new and exciting level of intimacy that deepens the physical, spiritual, and emotional aspects of your sacred connection.  We will explore couple-hood as a yogic path to realization, letting go of the mind and surrendering to the heart through your lover. It is a practice of using your two-ness to realize oneness.  Yoga and Qigong are like brother and sister. Both are esoteric, alchemical practices that were created for self-realization, with exercise being a secondary benefit. Qigong is much gentler than most forms of yoga, and a wonderful compliment to a vigorous yoga practice. Both practices have a common source, Neolithic shamanic practices, and both are ancient books of wisdom written in the language of the body. We'll physically explore the connection between these 2 books of wisdom within the context of your love relationship. We are channeling the sexual and creative energies of the body through visualization, movement, ritual, and breath, not sexual activity. Tantric Qigong is an intimate practice of being gentle with oneself and weaving one's own sexual energy, becoming truly receptive.</p>

        <p class="description">Artist: Cynthia Fleischmann-www.Bodypaintography.com
What: Participate in an ‘Artistic Happening’ where you will be invited to strip naked, cover yourself in Playa dust with painted cracks and red hands to simulate a connection with yourself in your purest form, the environment and each other. The purpose is to bring us back to our most natural state of being, with the desert environment and red hands symbolizing life and death, love and hate. The more participants the better, helping to create a unifying and liberating experience which will be documented with photography and film, to be posted on the website Bodypaintography.com. Look for flags with Red Hands and buckets that need help filling! Lets make this gathering impressive and expressive together! Don’t forget to bring water for hydration.
When: The happening takes place 3pm dusting preparation, 5 pm documenting the outcome.
Where:  Meet near the Temple…look for the flags with Red Hands!</p>

        <p class="description">After three years of roaming the deep playa this mobile art installation has decided to settle down and start its roots at the Siberian Electric Company.  The Electric Lazy Lounge is more than a full sensory experience. Through its process of sensory overload it allows participants to disassociate from their sense of self and travel beyond this consciousness to a realm that can only be described as LazyLand. Combined with the incredible power of the playa's only nuclear reactor, the Siberian Electric Company, the Electric Lazy Lounge is stronger than ever and now capable of transporting participants beyond this universe into other dimensions of time and space.  Not only is the Electric Lazy Lounge the only way to get to LazyLand, it’s truly the best seat in the house. It will be open nightly with the bar.</p>

        <p class="description">Medicine Dance is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance ceremony supporting the emergence of living Oneness and what it truly means to be embodied and aware in all of our Humanness. It is fun & empowering. Anyone can do it. Using movement, we work with the 5 elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether to access the unique Medicine that is encoded within each of us and create a deeper relationship to our Selves, Others, and LIFE. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work, we gain tools that help us to move through life in a more centered & conscious manner, embracing the shifting currents as exactly the Medicine we need for our healing & growth. We come together peacefully to create a deep space of exploration, safety, shared practice, transformation and community.</p>

6pm @ The Trash Fence
Burning Man Festival
Black Rock City, Nevada

Join us to witness and celebrate our union at 6pm "The Golden Hour” of the day at the legendary “Trash Fence” about 100yds to the right of Point 3 (straight out from the man/temple line and a little to the right).

Come by foot, bike or art car! Those seeking a ride via Love Potion/Amphora Art Car have the option of meeting at Camp Manifestation (9:35&E) at 5:00pm-5:15pm.

You are invited to wear your playa best and join us for a champagne toast after the ceremony.

A Side Note: If you have never been to the trash fence you may think we are crazy to have such a special ceremony at such a strange place. Well we are crazy but you will soon understand why the trash fence sounds like rubbish to some and magic to others…

Why Burning Man? Crazy right!?
Why yes we are! And since BM is where we met, it seemed the most perfect place for us to get married. There is NO obligation to attend. If you can join us, we'd love to have you! We are so happy to have a wedding without seating arrangements so the MORE the MERRIER!</p>

        <p class="description">A 333 Peace Windsinger Band, will play their Windsinger instruments (Windsinger.org), sending a message out to our Space Brothers & Sisters, as we perform John Williams score, "Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind" (or Close Encounters of the Frum Kind). We will start to gather at 11pm after the regional burn and begin the performance at 11:59pm Thur 8-29, creating the first Midnight Mass Windphony, ever in the history of humankind! 

The plan is to create a human / color-light & sound vibrational bridge connecting the Man, the Temple and Way Beyond (what ever that means for you) through a vibrational alignment of individual players. We are inviting conscious hoopers, fire dancers and any other  "instruments of mass creation" to sync up with this vibrational field of PEACE & LOVE. This is the only pre-requisite for BAND Members, as we open a "Quantum Portal" bridging our highest potential, creating a "morphogenic field," reaching inter-dimensionally through time and space, connecting all those attuned to this vibrational field.

Come and Play...even if you are not on the Playa, join us on a vibrational level...and if you do make it, ONLY COME IF YOU CAN HOLD A POSITIVE THOUGHT OF LOVE AND PEACE! We will create a cosmic "string of pearls" that will produce a universal ripple...reaching Eternity ItSelf! This IS Cult Cargo at its finest, with only our highest and best intentions in mind, as we collectively "reach out and touch some ONES..." And if the time and space permits...maybe, just maybe, the recipients of our Mass Windphony will come and  join us in this 3rd dimensional reality... with the veils already thinned  through the very spirit of Burning man...anything is possible! 

Come Play in the Band and help create this cosmic wave...

Register at https://www.facebook.com/windsingerX and if you want to be part of the Windphony. Bring a Windsinger, or let us know if you want to own an instrument of your own, as part of our non-profit Windsinger Xperience!</p>

An ecstatic, somatic, dance journey to awaken your body, heart and mind and reconnect you to your inner dance shaman.

We will journey deep into the inner chambers of our body, heart and spirit to retrieve those parts of ourselves that we have hidden from, abandoned, suppressed or felt ashamed of. With Love and Compassion we will reclaim these parts of ourselves to create space for the light to seep in, to heal, reveal and reconnect us with the totality of who and what we are. We gather in safe and sacred way to dance our way to wholeness and freedom. In a Dancing Freedom practice we layer dance, music, breath, intent, energy, prayer and mindfullness within a single practice for inspiration, liberation and participation.  It is a free-form ecstatic, somatic & shamanic movement prayer ~ a community oriented method of dance therapy, a sacred practice & a soul return ~ friendly for all ages, abilities and bodies.</p>

Appreciate the indigenous stillness and aesthetics of the Black Rock desert in a cordoned-off zone free of motorized vehicles and loud amplified music. The Otic Way is a wilderness outpost providing an
audio antidote and alternative of peace and quiet, deep in Walk-In Camping, where no motorized vehicles are permitted and large scale sound systems don’t penetrate.  At last, a retreat where the aural options are in keeping with the indigenous stillness and aesthetics of the Black Rock Desert. It will provide shade and shelter to weary travelers who might require a bit of tranquility and quiet in order to recharge and allow them to commune with their internal and external environments. The Otic Way is an arc of individual Satellites with a central Shade area, composed of geometric crystalline clusters of interwoven modules, that provide individualized and group spaces for meditation and contemplation of the sunrise, sunset and our natural surroundings. The biomimicry of the design complements the desert backdrop and offers a manmade structure that takes inspiration from the rocks, mountains, caves, and plateaus found in nature. It is made completely of interlocking wood, with no nails or metal fasteners.</p>

What better place to celebrate their love than a fun ceremony of some sort at the beautiful temple of grace. We're not sure exactly what this will be but its a ceremony/party to celebrate their love and give tribute to this special place they met. All are welcome to share the love!

        <p class="description">the FCLL, purveyor of the St Stupid's Day Parade in SF every 4/1 since '79 , the one pretty true religion, will be performing miracles at the Souk, as well as re-membering you into the world's largest church, the world's oldest religion. All religions are based on fear and/or guilt…but before that can happen , you have to be stupid enough to believe that con…thus making the FCLL the stem cell religion. Come find out just why you, the spiritual consumer/seeker, is already a member, and have just 'forgotten'. Re-membrance is an almost totally painless six step ritual with no aftertaste. 
Bishop Joey, seminal and secular head of the FCLL, and instigator of the annual St. Stupid parade thru the SF financial district, along with his highly trained acolytes, the deep phat friars and the somz (we don't have nuns, cuz are nuns are gettin some)[insert rim shot here]. 
The Taberknuckle of St Stupid will perform these miracles, blessings and secret rituals at the foot of the man at various moments of the day and night. A self guided tour will also be availabubble. 
  Experience the OATH of the ORACLE
                    the SOCK EXCHANGE
                    the LEAP of FAITH
                    the BLESSING of the BANKERS HEART
                    the CONFESSION of  STUPIDITY
                    the SECRET HANDSHAKE
Become one with the knowledge of your own insignificancy and your connection with the unavoidable 'stupidity' of the species….or is that becoming 'two'….? 
Accept St Stupid as your own two dimensional spiritual scapegoat and feel the difference in 90 days or your time and/or money cheerfully refunded. How can you beat a deal like that? you can't, not on this side singularity!!

In the desert; amidst dreamers, visionaries, magicians and playful travelers, the Nordic Oracle will function as a portal for wisdom where burners connects with each other and the spirit of Burning Man.

The Oracle will have a strong voice, that will be felt by those who inquire and their experience will be remembered for years to come.

Odin's two ravens Hugin and Munin, will roam the desert, the playa, and search for the Burners that will be given the message that they are the ones, and they have the chance to become the voice of Mimir and the fate that the future brings. The Oracle will counsel and predict, make enigmatic statements, ambiguous or obscure utterances, allegories and revelations. Some will make sense and others will remain a mystery.

Burners gather in the Nevada because we are one kind, one force connected to the spirit of Burning Man. All that has been heard and all that has been seen will inspire to share the revelations.</p>

I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy.

After years of struggling to love herself and looking outside to her parents, the media and of course - men - for validation, Julia Allison has come home to the fact that she will never feel whole in love until she loves herself wholly. Please join this exuberant celebration & sacred ritual of self-love, officiated by Rabbi Marc Gafni and Priestess of Love Annie Lalla, with performances by bridesmaids The Shes, Maid of Honor Nisha Moodley, and a special performance by the Bride herself. The entire community will recite vows of commitment to themselves. And yes, the Bride will be wearing white.</p>

Fear sometimes get embedded deep in our psyche and will remain there until and unless we choose to address them. Granted it is easy to ignore our fears and stay in the comfort zone, yet imagine life's possibilities if we confront our fears. 

In this workshop, we will breakthrough our fears by breaking an arrow with our throat as a metaphorical exercise. It can be fear related to us growing up as queer individuals or any other personal fears that gets in our way to becoming our full two-spirit beautiful self. Participants must be sober to participate. Limited arrows available.</p>

Don’t forget a meaningful gift that you can exchange with other participants who stood next to you during this ceremony.  Participate or come to celebrate with others, it’s open to all.</p>

 a hands-on, physical experience of the ritual celebration.  The workshop begins with a ritual purification, connecting heart, body, mind, and spirit. Then it moves you into a deeper state of consciousness and closer to your individual and collective soul’s purpose. Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and global music, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations and allow their innermost creative sides to break free. Dancers tune in to sound and movement to take an inner journey exploring a trance-like state of self-discovery and self-realization.</p>

        <p class="description">Join us in the Lotus Dome for the daily recitation of Nam Myoho Renge Kyo and morning gongyo (the practice of chanting two chapters from the Lotus Sutra). In the Lotus Sutra, Shakymuni Buddha revealed that every human being can attain enlightenment in their present form. Through chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, an individual is able to awaken this enlightenment the Buddha revealed and reveal their own Buddha nature. A practitioner of this Buddhism, through chanting and study, can transform their life and create a state of unshakable happiness, overcoming the sufferings of birth and death. Buddhism is a practice and everyone is welcome to join. Each day after chanting, together we will study a Buddhist concept, answer questions, and share experiences about the practice and its application to our daily life. All are welcome to join us. Novices, new practitioners, and curious souls welcome.</p>

KavAquatic will be serving kava from late afternoon to the first hours of the night as is traditionally done in the Pacific Islands of Vanuatu, New-Caledonia and Fiji, in a setting taking you right back to an island paradise!

As a tribute to the magic of the Pacific Island experience and goodwill, our campsite will be a dedicated and epically tranquil chill-out zone. Kavaquatic will be an island paradise perfect for individuals or groups to relax, recuperate and connect. Coupled with traditional kava beverages served at sundown each evening, our campsite will make for the perfect escape from the hot, dry, dusty desert, and one that even the most experienced burner will seek out at some stage. This oasis-in-the-desert experience will be complemented by our camp's guiding principles of inclusion, self expression and camaraderie.</p>

His friends weren't surprised to discover that he was loved and admired by an extended sea of humanity and that is what we most hope to celebrate. Johnny was an integral member of the New York City Burning Man community and a loving "playa mama" to his campmates at Love Potion and Duck & Cover. We plan to toast him with a Happy Hour at Love Potion, then migrate to The Man, where some of his ashes will be in The Man's heart. From there, we will erect our memorial to him in The Temple and, finally, travel to deep playa to scatter his ashes at sunset. It will be festive and filled with joy, just as Johnny was. For us, it will be as if he is joining us on the playa one more time! Bring bikes and booze!</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="description">Hotshot the Robot returns to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his 1st birthday. No singing, he hates that. Don't offer him a beer, he hates that too. 

Hotshot was born Friday during the 2004 burn near the 3:00 plaza.

It is with heavy heart he returns to the place of his birth after a nasty bout of losing himself in a search of fame and fortune. 

It was only after locking on to his self-reflection in a pool in the Hollywood hills, high on some kinda smack did he see what he had become. It was one of those infinity pools that seems like it falls away to the surrounding landscapes. They got really trendy in the middle to late 90's and this one in particular had really nice cultured stone placed to look completely natural almost...

A pool of robo-flection, falling away to nowhere...in this case it happened to be the gorgeous smog filled sky overlooking the 405 south and the 101. 

"What have I become?" he whispers to himself whispering back at himself.  
"Why am I wearing this amazing floral print burgundy kimono robe?" which was actually made for him personally by one of the finest seamstresses in the Sai Kung district of Hong Kong. 

He had been had by himself having been had. 

No more. It was time to get back to what mattered most in Hotshot's life. I mean after all, no skeezer in all of Orange County could tighten his nuts half as much as The Burn had in the past. Just because he doesn't have feelings, doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings. 

There is no shame in going.........home. 

Hotshot immediately logged onto his brand new Macbook Pro with the 13.3" HD Retina screen and made his first steps towards the playa and logged onto Stubhub and bought a ticket for $1175.00. After his friends said he couldn't fit his bean bag chair in their ride he went to ebay and purchased a car pass for $389 (free shipping) and folks the rest they say is history. 

Come say hello old friends and new friends alike. 3:00 plaza all week, only God knows when.</p>

Through chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo, one can create a state of unshakable happiness. Buddhism is a practice and everyone is welcome to join. Each day after chanting, together we will study a Buddhist concept, answer questions, and share experiences. Novices, new practitioners, and curious souls welcome.</p>

        <p class="description">Want to HEAL the rift between the Masculine and Feminine? In yourself and in humanity? Men create the outer ring - witnessing. Women are inside - receiving. Love transforms all.

'The Divine Masculine and Feminine Healing Circle' is an event where the men of the playa are invited to step into their higher selves, and consciously hold the energy of the Divine Masculine. Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. 

When men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness them, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities do this, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new balance.</p>

experience ritual celebration in movement therapy that heals and frees physical, mental, emotional and spiritual blockages through dance, breathwork, and contemporary Shamanism. The workshop begins with a ritual purification, connecting heart, body, mind, and spirit. Then it moves you into a deeper state of consciousness and closer to your individual and collective soul’s purpose. Utilizing dance, contemporary shamanism, hands on healing, drumming and global music, this powerful and beautiful soul work sheds inhibitions and heightens inner awareness in a safe and carefully monitored group setting. Dancers are blindfolded in the shamanic tradition and step beyond their conscious fears and limitations to allow their innermost creative sides to break free. with Dina T</p>

        <p class="description">A True Reflections Palace - showcasing mirrors that do not reverse left and right!

Come see the sparkle in your eyes from the light in your soul.  These mirrors reflect you as you are, not reversed, and are truly magical!  

Theres both science and an art here - your face "works" when you see it as it truly is.  In contrast it stops working, and you tend to stare at yourself in mirrors. Then get self-critical all too often. Even if you are feeling wonderful, like all so many times at Burning Man, a mirror doesn't reflect it naturally, so you tend to lose that sparkle and start to question your good feelings.  

In contrast, when you look in one of these true reflection mirrors, your face keeps working!  Your eyes, which have so much beautiful information in them, continue to have that same information that you can see.  This is what we see and read so well when we look at you.  That sparkle when you are happy, that depth when you are being deep, that vitality and genuineness that we know about you, now you can see it too!  So easy to believe in yourself when you see all that true energy you have. 

The result?  Expect to be absolutely floored.  You are an amazing creature - a Human Being, and now you can see what that really looks, and feels like.  The feedback loop you find yourself in now is clear and complete, so smiles look like real smiles and you will smile back.  Complete with sparkle!!! Beautiful!

There's lots of posters in the Palace (which is made from giant tinker style toys) to explain it all.  If you don't see the magic, ask one of us for a demo and explanation. .. we want to get you to your own AHA moment!   

Note-this is the same Palace that has been under the Man, on Playa, on Esplanade and in Center Camp!  Don't Miss It - Its Magic!</p>

Have a playa name? Embrace the rite of passage. It is never too late. 

Don't have a playa name? Find any veteran of ten burns and request to spend time with them so they may divine a name that suits you. Or stop by Zerodrome days before this event for assistance from one of our sages.

Standing among peers, be acknowledged and born again as a child of the Burn. The Grand Zero of Black Rock leads the ceremony, summoning and channeling the eternal energies that bind atoms throughout the universe. Swell with the pride of legitimacy through this rite of passage.

I started asking friends if I could paint their auras and came to find that my impressions of color and energy aligned with the individual's current state of being. The process requires a hint of vulnerability and casual conversation. Using oil and chalk pastels I will create an image of the energy you emit.
The process can take 15 to 30 minutes depending on the complexity of the aura. It is my passion to capture the aura in its nautical beauty. 
Upon completion, I give an interpretation of the aura,</p>

SHUL is prayer + dance, niggunim + bass = a Shabbat morning service that engages all our senses and all our limbs in prayer.

Let's aim for ~15-20 minutes of procession, followed by any additional participation with the Temple you choose. Afterwards we will scatter to share the spirit & purpose of this year's temple.

In perihelion to this event, some of us winged folk will gather again for a night-time circling of the temple, at midnight after the temple burn, around the ashes of the Temple.

Note: The Temple Guardians enthusiastically anticipate this participation, and only ask that we be prepared for them to begin the soft-close of the temple around dawn on Sunday, followed by the firm closure by 8 AM. Parking bikes >500' away from the Temple is requested if you want to stay in the area past 8 AM.

        <p class="description">Nordic burners are bringing our favorite celebration of the year to playa: Midsommar!
===
There are infinite ways of enjoying Midsommar – and your way is the true way. Wrap yourself up in what will be a party of surreal levels of myth and ancient Viking traditions, or just enjoy what seems to be a pretty straight forward kids’ party for grown-ups celebrating fertility. 


There will be enigmatic traditional dancing, confused games, and drinks that will make you sing songs of tales long forgotten. And it will all take place below the 30 feet tall fertility penis, err, maypole, which will watch over us all and make us fertile as all fuck.


For an optimal midsummer celebration and a magical night, you must find 7 flowers in our camp to dream of your future love, do the traditional frog dance, and drink an absurd amount of schnapps!


For an optimal midsummer celebration and a maxed out magical night you will need to find 7 kinds of flowers in our camp, which will make you dream of your future love. Last but not least, there will of course be spaced out frog dancing and an absurd amount of snaps!


If the party gets too weird, you can also have a ‘fika’ to see we have more conventional customs as well.


The party will take place at the Northern Light Camp 3.15 & Florian Thursday 4.


Maypole dance and games will take place between 4 and 6pm. 


Lots and love, flowers, rainbows and fluffy greetings,

        <p class="description">Together let us become “Awake and Ready” with Paramhansa Yogananda’s Energization Exercises & Prayer for world peace.  Prepare your mind and spirit for another uplifting day on the Playa!  Yogananda claimed the purpose of exercise was to awaken an inner energy source.  His series of energization exercises were designed to bring both energy and calm.  The exercises “purify the bloodstream and recharge every cell with cosmic energy.” The aim is to gain increased awareness and control over your life force and to identify more with the soul than the body.  This event happens just before yoga and meditation at Buddha Camp and is a great way to wake up and prepare your body and mind for those sessions.  All the exercises are done from a standing position and anyone, regardless of fitness level, can benefit.  Following the exercises we will repeat together, Yogananda's Peace and Harmony Prayer for World Peace.  This event is 30 minutes long.  Come join us!</p>

but you may not know that it was based on the Tibetan Book Of The Dead and that John Lennon imagined it as having thousands of monks chanting in the background. 

At this Temple event we will have everyone chanting Om Mani Padme Hum together for a while, then singing Tomorrow Never Knows along with the chant.  I have recorded a backing track for this event, so it is easier for us all to stay together in tempo and pitch, plus as a reminder for the song lyrics. But the most important audio at the event will be your voice!</p>
