        <p class="description">Paradise Motel is the most garish of roadside motels; yet the best of the "no-tel" genre, where weary travelers are invited to stop in for a snow cone and enjoy some progressive beats while lounging by the "pool". This year you can come find out if you've gotten a bit too much fertility by visiting our on site clinic for pregnancy test! We've been told we have the best Snow Cones on the Playa. Well, at least with the least amount of Playa Dust mixed in. Times are approximate ... we'll have the stand open from when we wake up till we get tired. We also appreciate gifts of bags of ice. (Must be unopened) Look for the pink flamingoes and the pink RV known as "The USS Nancy Reagan"</p>

        <p class="description">Our goal for this "Miso soup camp" is to prevent electrolyte imbalance for Burners. 
According to wikipedia, Pure miso paste nutritional information: Although high in sodium (over 400% DV), one cup (275 g) of miso paste is an excellent source of dietary fiber (59%) and protein (64% DV), as well as a good source of minerals . Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content.
We believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.</p>

After years of trials in kitchens both on and off Playa, Chef Badger intends to satisfy your curiosity, your belly and perhaps even your soul with his scintillating offerings. Join fellow Burners amidst moody cave-like interiors alongside our open kitchen as your mouth encounters flavors as fertile as a budding Earth. Seating begins at 10:00 (first come/first served) or stop by the Proto-Bar for cocktails and nosh.</p>

Each year we have had a huge turnout, so come early to get a good seat, and bring something to sit on if you can.    

In this workshop I will share background, history, benefits, and instructions for how you can incorporate fermented and activated foods into your life.  
There will also be a variety of fermented food & drink samples to stimulate your palate, and awaken your body to the magic of these healing foods.  

After the workshop is over, everyone is invited to stay and share a variety of fermented foods and drinks.  Participants are encouraged to bring items to share with others.</p>

        <p class="description">Our goal for this "Miso soup camp" is to prevent electrolyte imbalance for Burners. According to wikipedia, Pure miso paste nutritional information: Although high in sodium (over 400% DV), one cup (275 g) of miso paste is an excellent source of dietary fiber (59%) and protein (64% DV), as well as a good source of minerals . Miso paste is also high in amino acids, the basic building blocks of protein. An excellent source of vitamin K and a decent source of riboflavin (38% DV), miso also provides small amounts of other vitamins. One major benefit of miso is its extremely high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content. We believe Miso saves Burners life on the Playa and leave them with good health all day.</p>

        <p class="description">In order to fight the threat of food-borne illness on the playa, the Nevada State Health Division (NSHD) has requirements for camps preparing food including the need of a health permit and an inspection. You must apply for and be permitted as a Temporary Food Establishment by the NSHD if:

* You will be cooking or serving food to large groups of more than 125* FELLOW CAMPERS of your theme camp on a consistent basis.

(If you have a communal kitchen shared by 125 or more campers, but meals are prepared individually, or in smaller quantities than for 125 persons, a permit is not required, however we highly recommend you research and review safe food handling practices, starting with the Nevada Division of Health information).

* You wish to share, cook or serve food or non-alcoholic beverages to the general Burning Man population (gifting food).

Here are the permit procedures and deadlines:

If you have already applied for a permit, you should be receiving instructions in the mail soon.

If you are planning to make and give away food or drinks to the public on the playa including fresh squeezed juice, coffee with dairy, or even snow cones, you need a permit. Here's the scoop from Cindy Ulch, Supervisor with the Nevada State Health Divisions Public Health and Clinical Services Environmental Health Program:

The only application any camp needs is the "Food Permit Application for Burning Man" found here:
http://health.nv.gov/BFHS_EHS.htm 

Don't wait until the last minute. It would be a shame to have to cancel your plans, or even risk being closed at the event.  That mailing address is  NSHD - PHCS 475 West Haskell Street Suite 38, Winnemucca, NV 89445.

In person:  No later than THURSDAY AUGUST 23rd - 4150 Technology Way Suite 100, Carson City, NV.  Phone: (775) 687-7550 or 475 West Haskell Street Suite 38 Winnemucca, NV.  Phone (775) 623-6588.</p>

Oh, the weather is nice? Why not take this repast on your favorite backyard patio? 

Gemini and her friends are all about dining al fresco and invite you their BRC patio to bring a cup and enjoy over five types of vodka bloody marys, a bloody maria, and even a virgin version for those designated drivers out there.

There will also be BACON (duh?!) and bacon-infused, flavored, wrapped, and other goodies. Nothing virgin/vegetarian about the food. It's all salty, meaty, fatty goodness meant to complement the drinks and your appetite!

We'll be open around 930am (you know, playa time)... and serve until we are bled dry for the day. 

Bawdy jokes encouraged (especially about meat, bleeding, and deliciousness), hugs always accepted, and kisses may be stolen.</p>

Everyone who brings a beer gets beer. We'll open a beer randomly still in the bag, pour out samples for all, try them and discuss. Then we'll reveal what it was and see how the style compares to your perception. 
The bag keeps people from forming preconceived notions of any sort - but Bud/Miller/Coors still suck - and the discussion will sharpen your beer vocabulary.</p>

Fitting in with his year's Art Theme "Caravansary" and our own kitschy aesthetic we decided if you take kitschy and vaguely middle eastern you get ... why the silly 60s sitcom "I Dream of Jeannie" so we've recreated the inside of Jeannie's bottle as this year's "roadside attraction".   Other attractions include our resident Mad Scientist's Mutant Animal Zoo and clothes closet.  Times are approximate ... we'll have the stand open from when we wake up till we get tired.  We also appreciate gifts of bags of ice. (Must be unopened) And as always, if you show your junk, you get to cut to the front (of the snow cone queue).</p>

Roasted Breaux & Coffee Heaux Coffee Camp will be open on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 2-4 PM. Bring family, friends, lovers and strangers and create your own unique blend from our wide range of International coffees.  You have the opportunity to hand grind you own unique selection of coffee that will be served pour-over style. Then pull up a chair or a pillow and sit, relax and visit with friends, new and old, in our coffee house lounge.

We will also be roasting our coffee at various times throughout the week so you won’t find a fresher cup of coffee in BRC. Come in, hang out and if you feel up to it, join in and help us roast our next batch of Roasted Breaux and Coffee Heaux coffee.  

Ask about coming by and roasting your own on-the-playa beans to bring back to the default world (a little playa dust in the mix makes a great brew!) or help us gift a fresh cup of coffee to the burners who are serving the BRC community.

In the LNT (Leave No Trace) spirit, please remember to bring your own cup.</p>

That’s right! It's baaaaaaack! How hot can you take it? Spicy, savory, and DEFINITELY alcoholic, join us for even more bacon, even bloodier marys, and some lovely bottoms for all to view (ask before you fondle!)! Bring your own cup to Camp GTFO (location TBD) for the best*, hottest*, and TASTIEST* bloody marys and goodies on the Playa! . (* dustiest; let's not kid ourselves.) There are usually other food goodies available, as we see fit and depending on how drunk we got the night before/that morning. We'll also have our famous Hydration Station for those who aren't drinking or for those under 21 (because they can all still eat BACON, right?! Shush, it's a rhetorical question.) . Also revisit the ARE YOU A BLOODY PUSSY OR WHAT? bar, and see how hot you can take it when Gemini pours whatever the hell she damn well feels like into a shot glass for you to drink. Want to earn YOUR red wings?! Have a seat in our living room, dance the morning away in Tiny Club, play on the trampoline (clothing optional, of course!), or write in the shared journal!

        <p class="description">Soul food got its name in the 1960's from the commensality - or practice of eating together - of generations of Southerners who headed far from their family origins during the Great Migration. It reminded them of home.

Soul Brunch isn't just a party; it's like the backyard barbecues of home. It's like the cookouts of yesteryear. As your families invited your communities over, as the generations of soul families invited their communities over, so too does the Heroes & Super Villains family invite the Playa community over to eat together, drink together, get to know one another, dance with each other and uplift each other.

From morning until nightfall, our trained chefs serve up the freshest breakfast burritos on the Playa, accompanied by professionally made craft cocktails. Our collection of international DJs spin smooth beats until nightfall.

We also give revelers a chance to clean up with our Soul Power Showers; guests experience the rebirth and rejuvenation of cool, cleansing water sprayed forcefully from our pressurized washer system (imagine a water saving car wash inside our shower areas for guests). Baptized anew, heroes set out on their way spreading positive vibes.

DJ Lineup:
-Marques Wyatt
-Nicodemus
-Deep Woods
-Sabo

Create your own unique blend of coffee from our selection of international Playa-roasted coffee, grind your beans, and enjoy it served pour-over style.  Sit, relax and chill with friends new and old in our Arabian-inspired coffee house lounge. 
We will be roasting coffee at various times during the week so you won't find a fresher cup of coffee in BRC, or anywhere!!!  
If you would like, please join in and help us roast our next batch of Roasted Breaux and Coffee Heaux Playa-blend.  Ask about coming by and roasting your own on-the-Playa beans to bring back to the default world (a little Playa dust is the secret ingredient!), or help us gift coffee to the burners who serve our community.  
In the LNT (Leave No Trace) spirit, please remember to bring your own cup.  Or you may have to play a special carnival game to "earn" one...</p>

Roasted Breaux & Coffee Heaux Coffee Camp will be open on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 1-3 PM. Bring family, friends, lovers and strangers and create your own unique blend from our wide range of International coffees.  You have the opportunity to hand-grind you own unique selection of coffee that will be served pour-over style. Then pull up a chair or a pillow and sit, relax, listen to music and visit with friends, new and old, in our coffee house lounge.

We will be roasting our coffee at various times throughout the week so you won’t find a fresher cup of coffee in BRC. Come in, hang out and if you feel up to it, join in and help us roast our next batch of Roasted Breaux and Coffee Heaux coffee.  

Ask about coming by and roasting your own on-the-playa beans to bring back to the default world (a little playa dust in the mix makes a great brew!) or help us gift a fresh cup of coffee to the burners who are serving the BRC community.

In the LNT (Leave No Trace) spirit, please remember to bring your own cup, or subject yourself to the “Wheel of Misfortune” (cue the sinister music)!!!</p>

It's cold, filthy, and far from home out there. There may be wolves, or people dressed like wolves, or a screaming metal monster than someone once called a wolf before science happened to it! No matter, what you need is safety, light, and food! We've got yer back!

Get'cher hot, salty, broth and noodles. We'll have 'em till we don't, you'll slurp 'em down till they're gone. And hey-ho-diddley-hey chuckles, they ain't from no styrofoam cup. Come on down to flavor country, and ride the noodle! (No actual rides present at camp, just noodles...please don't try and ride your noodles, that would just be awkward, and probably messy)

AND BEFORE YOU ASK:
No, they're not gluten free, they're frikkin noodles.
No, they're not vegan. Stop asking. We're not that kind of noodle.
There probably won't be any pandas, geese, or other assorted whimsical creatures unless you bring them yourself.</p>

Get'cher tasty noodles. We'll have 'em till we don't, you'll slurp 'em down till they're gone. Delicious noodles, yummy hot dog pieces, everything you need for evening fun!

Not gluten free, not vegan. Seriously, stop asking, the hot dogs should be a dead giveaway.
