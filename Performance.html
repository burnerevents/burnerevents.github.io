        <p class="description">I have a small computer graveyard in my closet, and I bet I’m not the only one. Do you have an old laptop or keyboard and monitor taking up space? Put it to good use!

Imagine blocks of skyscrapers filled with little rooms where people, much like you and I spend most of their waking hours – moving their digits across letters on plastic pads with symbols on them.

Our tools are now more advanced, with many flavors of computing, input and output devices, most of which are connected. These devices, and the possibilities they open up, have (with our help of course) developed marvelously diverse ways of subtly thieving away more and more of our time. Any metropolis today represents an ever-evolving symbiosis with technology.

Helps us explore this topic on-Playa in 3 easy steps:
1. Bring an old laptop or monitor/keyboard with you to Black Rock City this year.
2. Show up at 7PM on Friday at the halfway point between the Man and Center Camp along the 6 o’clock avenue.
3. We ask that you sit down forming a grid and look busy, typing for 20-25 minutes,

We will work with the town of Gerlach to set up techno-trash bins you can use on the way out, or if your device still works after the playa treatment, look into donating it to the Gerlach school district.

More details to come, but the core of the idea is really rather simple. Let's do a little exploration of how modern humans spend their time on this planet.
Thoughts and ideas, and of course participation are very welcome.</p>

        <p class="description">Part alchemy and part black magic,  FreeStyle Palace is an amalgam of sophisticated and authentic Urban Underground music and culture forged by the heat of the Black Rock Desert and polished by the collective talent of Burning Man Participants. 

We interpret the 2010 Metropolis theme as a tribute and embrace of the Urban Underground experience we have shared with our Burning Man community for the past six years.   

In his discussion of the Metropolis theme, Larry Harvey must have been thinking about FreeStyle Palace when he described “hubs of social interaction” which “generate the pulse of urban life.”  

FreeStyle Palace is a “hub” of many cultures, races and generations.  We produce a steady “pulse” via amplified kick drum and electronic beat.   The “hub” and “pulse” of FreeStyle Palace is a backdrop for Burning Man Participants to create a personal Urban Underground experience like those which radiated from cities both modern and ancient.</p>

Malvoye knows all, Malvoye sees all. 

Seeking love, wealth or the answer to that burning question deep inside you? Each and every reading gives YOU the chance to ask Malvoye your most burning questions. So, come one, come all—put Malvoye to the test! Malvoye's beautiful assistants will instruct you on the proper use of the machine. BUT DO BEWARE, as true fortunes convey more than mere pacifying happiness and positivity. 

Now heard in fully restored Vita-phonic sound! 

A truly unique experience for the citizens of the playa, this Deco 1930's booth was only just recently restored after nearly being lost to time and the elements. The booth, reportedly once part of a now long defunct traveling sideshow, was famous for its uncanny accuracy and genuine powers. In its day, it was said to be the creation of Edgar Cayce (the "Sleeping Prophet") who was somehow able to imbue his power into the booth. It is also said to be the true inspiration for the Tom Hanks's film Big. It is believed to be one of only five Malvoye booths made and the only one known to have survived. It has been painstakingly rewired and restored by a group of burners in the Philadelphia area who happened upon the booth at a local auction and flea market.

***The booth will only be powered and functioning during the times listed though other random nightly hours will be added, especially around the nights of the burns. PLEASE DO NOT attempt to use the booth during other times as you could easily damage it, respect the set boundaries and do not touch the booth.</p>

Topless women receive a PARTICIPANT Certificate. This is a good way to be nude without appearing nude. You will find you are more photogenic and more approachable to conversations. I have over a thousand satisfied customers. See me 10-2 M-F at Center Camp, Man entrance. Great prep for Critical Tits bicycle ride on Friday. Hope to see you.</p>

A Shadowground crisscrossed by phantom alleyways that twist between the no-longer, the never-ever and the farthest reaches of your imaginings. The dwellers here are myths and legends, only real to dreamers, only found when lost. Only in such a place can broken toys come to life. only in such a place do marionettes come to wander...

We are the Wandering Marionettes, a Los Angeles based dance, circus and performance art troupe blending circus-freak and goth-punk aesthetics with hip-hop moves and attitude, creating a truly unique, dark and mysterious glamour certain to mesmerize and inspire.

The Wandering Marionettes and Special Guest performers join creative forces with Muse and the Happenstance Clan to bring you an unforgettable evening of performance and music.  Start time 9 pm, Friday evening.  Before the show starts at 9:30 explore Muse, a three story pagoda that will house the Marionettes (and friends) and all their interactive environments!

        <p class="description">4pyre² is a 12ft pipe with propane burners on each end.  When the burners fire, the pipe is propelled around on two axes, tracing out the surface of a 12ft diameter sphere.

(4πr² is the formula for the surface area of a sphere of radius r.)

Enabling this pipe to spin is a gleaming machine of aluminum, stainless steel, bearings, shafts, hoses, rotary fluid unions, sprockets, chains, motors, encoders, and microcontrollers.  Standing nearly 18’ tall, it holds the sphere of fire high enough that visitors can get quite close.  There is also a panel where visitors can control the angle and the thrust of the propane burners, creating different patterns through the sphere.

They will bring citizens of BRC Metropolis to their fantastic planet introducing them to some of the surreal and grotesque entities that belong in realms of darkness. Since 1988 “blackSKYwhite” has been shocking audiences in many famous international shows as Edinburgh Theatrical Festival, London International Mime Festival, Glastonbury Festival and dozens more. Finally this world famous and repeated awarded troupe comes to Burning man in 2010! 
Their shows illuminate the term 'total theatre': the costumes, scenery, lighting, music and movement blend so seamlessly into a language we all recognize in our deepest emotions and dreams. In this bizarre world there are aliens and creepy crawlies that are fascinating as they twitch and squirm. 
They are the products of a riotous imagination and we are as enthralled as we are repelled. There is beauty and fear, malice and mischief, magnificent creations jerking and wobbling and shuffling and slithering and bouncing around the stage. It is a dance macabre of feverish rhythms.</p>

Madi, the choir director, is an energetic, unique and fiery choral director who has been directing this ensemble for 6 years now! We welcome everyone that can sing or at least use your voice! and if you are mute or sworn to silence, we can find something for you to contribute too, if you want to be a part of our choir! (maybe you sign?) Singers of all abilities are welcome! We love readers, but if you don't read, it's OK. If you sing in the shower, we love you! If you sing to the radio, we want you! If you have choral experience, we need you! If you play a rhythm section instrument, please contact Madi right away! We give a Sunday service where we sing for a healthy and dusty audience at 11 am, so if you can't commit to the sunday service, well, you can still be a part of the choir! (but we'd rather you stuck around for the performance..!) This year, we will rehearse in Jazz Cafe, as we have in the past. But our sunday service will be in the center circle of center camp! This way, we should have enough room for the audience this time! come join us for some wonderful singing, fun and fierce rehearsals and a chance to meet some really awesome folks who you might not have met otherwise!</p>

        <p class="description">PHONOFLaKES: The best Alternative Rock / Power Pop that Europe has to offer!

Sometimes following your instincts is the easiest path to success. PHONOFLaKES from Switzerland, Europe followed this route.

The band presents emotional, yet wrenching work, which needs no explanation. With an uncompromising and spontaneous Alternative Rock / Power Pop, their music is a strong and honest impact that gets to you. And it is this strength, expressed through their simple but direct naturalness, which has always been a defining quality of the bands live shows.

PHONOFLaKES displays a personality equaled by no other band. Singer Melanie Schweickardt’s exceptional voice puts the band among the greatest Swiss bands – despite the fact they just started working on their debut long player in April 2010.

«We made it!» isn’t in the vocabulary of this tireless group. The main goal of PHONOFLaKES is to move ever forward. There’s no doubt what so ever – these guys know what to do and how to do it.

In 2009, the band played several shows in San Francisco’s Bay Area, a live radio showcase on KPDO 89.3 pirate cat radio and also performed on the center camp stage at Burning Man 2009.

PHONOFLaKES promised to come back to California and Burning Man 2010 and they will give you a night to remember!</p>

        <p class="description">Born in Chicago in the 80's, and a far cry from the civilized quiet Tuesday afternoon readings in back corners of libraries that you may have in mind when someone says "poetry", a poetry slam is a rowdy competition where the emphasis is on performance, entertainment and audience participation. Five judges will be placed in the audience and will give you a score out of 10 based on audience reaction. Poets job is to win over the audience.

A poem can be whatever you want it to be – a story, a rant, a social commentary, a personal confession. It can be funny, sexy, bizarre, political, truth or complete BS, whatever – provided that you follow a few simple rules, explained below.

-	Poems must be original material by the person who is performing
-	Poets get 3 minutes at the microphone. Points deducted for going over time
-	There will be two rounds. 12 poets in first round, 5 in second
-	No instruments or props allowed. Costumes should be kept to a minimal
-	Poems that attack others on basis of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or any other form of discrimination will not be tolerated and you will be disqualified

The event will begin at 5pm on Friday evening at Couch Burners Camp – 5.00 and Florence. This will be a fun event and the audience is encouraged to participate. Feel free to bring shakers, clappers, bells, whistles and other noise makers.

So now I am just in need of poets to compete! Step up, bring your mad poetry skills and an attitude and see you if you can walk away with the title of Black Rock City Burning Slam Grand Champion (and hopefully some prizes that I’m trying to source). Send me an email if you’re interested in competing. ajsiggie@gmail.com  I’m also in need of judges, so let me know if you would like to involved that way. 

See you on the Playa, where words become legends.

Peace

Participants (open to all shes, zes, and hes) will reveal their unique inner beauty in 2 categories:

1) The One Minute (no)Talent Competition: No rules, everyone has a talent - be it a stupid party trick or a fine art!

2) Interview: Do they do it for world peace, the children, or for the puppies?

All participants are beautiful and everyone wins by participating.

Please come with a sash and a tiara, and a gift to share with one other participant, via the Beauty Queen Gift Box.  Hosted by StacycatS, the original self-proclaimed beauty queen, in her first on-playa event since 2006!

NOTE: No beauty pageant is fair, bribing the "judges" and your host is encouraged. Participate for fun, rather than play to win!

The MBRC Project has produced events on-playa, around the USA, the UK and Spain since 2004. Check out the Miss Black Rock City website for photos, our theme song, and info on past events.

****************************************
SO, YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE A JUDGE?

Many people think that being a judge is cool, because of all the
bribes that the judges receive. But are you *really* up to the task?
Show up at the Boutique stage on Wednesday at 4pm SHARP with your
talents and your powers of persuasion in full effect... tardiness is
an anti-bribe! Be prepared to prove yourself to both StacycatS and
the pageant participants! Can you take it like you wanna give it?!

Maybe... if YOU ARE LUCKY... you will be one of five Miss Black Rock

This performance was inspired by and arranged from the Japanese traditional tea ceremony. The original ceremony consists of a variety of manners to drink, but to experience this fully, please drink with a style you favor most. The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. 

I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if you find any good idea for the future prospect of our metropolis throughout this performance. A big red umbrella will be there as the landmark. GRATEFUL RED!

Furthermore, I will exhibit my works and will serve you the tea again in San Francisco after Burning Man. Please join us when you are free. For more detail, please visit the following links.

We’ll be looking at themes like:  Less is the New More, and are No Impact, Zero Waste, and Carbon Neutral possible and feasible in our lives?  Will technology save us, or is it up to us to take the steps necessary to change our world, not to save our planet, but to save ourselves.  Come join us on this nightly journey when you want a respite from your journey in Black Rock City.  Our movie schedule will be available at our front desk.</p>

Enjoy Bloody Mary's Fish Juice & crunching the leftover bones. All are invited to meet their Doom with bad singing!

        <p class="description">Lillian tells the story of a young man kept awake by the fear that he’s watching his lover, who sleeps soundly in bed, drift away from him, becoming one of the many things he’s lost in his life.  He determines that all the things we lose end up in an island of trash floating in the Pacific Ocean and in a desperate attempt to reclaim these things; he sets off on a scuba-diving journey to that island. Along the way he meets strange sea creatures, who trigger discoveries within his mind’s journey to determine how and why he began to lose Lillian.  The young man’s desire for love propels him further into the night, and into a swell of events he could never have imagined.

JUNKraft is a boat built from 15,000 plastic bottles that sailed across the Pacific Ocean in 2008 to bring attention to the issue of plastic marine pollution. JUNK will be exhibited with a kiosk on plastic pollution built from waste salvaged from Hurricane Katrina. 

Disposable plastic waste, a byproduct of our ignorance and overconsumption, flows from land to sea through rivers and storm drains, getting stuck in massive, oceanic current systems called "gyres". Plastic accumulates in the gyres, breaking down into smaller and smaller fragments that are eaten by marine organisms. How might this affect human health? 

We have a story to tell about a better future, and want to begin by bringing this message to Black Rock City, through a resurrection of the JUNK</p>

The lines of vision and waves of hearing brushed her shoulder one day, and it started to come out as music.Some say it sounds like Joni Mitchell and Buffy Saint-Marie having tea with Feist. Some say it’s like teleportation into the mind’s eye of what could be, if we choose it. Some dance. Hear for yourself.Keep an eye to the sky and an ear to the sounds around… There is a revolution of conscious hearing, a casting-off of bitter judgment, and it’s in your eyes…</p>

        <p class="description">Before sundown on the fifth night of Burning Man, the Trojan Horse will begin its last “rights” of passage. Columns of Burners will pull the 20-ton beast on its massive cart across the playa and through the Gates of Troy to where the beast will burn.   A large procession with loud, cacophonic music will accompany the migration. The music, composed by Douglas Bevans, will be interactive and performed by a massive corps of drummers and brass players. The procession of costumed Greek deities and Greek and Trojan mortals will be solemn, the death march and last rites for the horse. We believe this will be one of the largest and most spectacular pieces of performance art ever brought to the playa.  Once the horse passes through the Gates of Troy, pure pandemonium (led by Pan) and a full-scale celebration with DJs and a powerful sound system will erupt. At midnight Artemis, Apollo, and their band of archers will shoot flaming arrows onto the upper reaches of the beast. Zor the Fyre God will finish torching the horse. In a spectacular conflagration, the horse will burn quickly and the party and dancing will resume around the fallen beams and embers. A riotous night of revelry (some orchestrated) will follow. Dionysius reigns!</p>

The exterior has all the visual cues, from the shingled roof, to the paneled siding, shuttered windows, etc. The inside is furnished with vintage furniture, 50’s wallpaper, elegant light fixtures, hardwood flooring, and hilarious photos from “Grahama’s” life on the walls. A working ceiling fan will cool the guests while they eat hard candy and experience the creature comforts of plastic covered sofas and creepy pictures from Grahama’s life. As a bonus, an actual “Grahama” will guilt trip you about your naughtiness and simultaneously make you feel like the specialist little boy/girl. It’s as if your real grahama were on the playa with you!

To celebrate her first year on playa we are having an all night party with live bands perched atop the roof! Granny may be old, but she knows how to party!</p>

        <p class="description">Have you always dreamed of throwing down a legendary DJ set at one of the hottest camps on the playa? Well, how bad do you Want It? We've got 10,000 watts of juicy sound, some of the best real estate in Black Rock City, and a nighttime crowd just waiting to be whipped into a frenzy. All you have to do is wow our panel of judges and you too could be headlining Burning Man!

For this contest we hearken back to that seminal masterpiece of talent programs: The Gong Show. Perhaps you remember the cringe-worthy showcase of questionable performances that critics could halt by striking a loud gong. This event is eerily similar, only ours has balls. Ovaries too. Giant, dusty gonads. Can you hang?

Instead of a gong, DJs will wear a shock collar and get buzzed off stage by volts of harsh rejection if they fail to impress. Instead of regaling us with tap dancing, DJs break out their most mind blowing tracks and slickest tricks. Instead of a paltry sum to commemorate victory, winners will be invited back during peak hours to pound the dance floor into submission. 

This is open decks for the fearless. Bring it.</p>

The theme: 50's or 60's with a Burner edge. Think flowery swim caps and nose plugs! The song: "What a Difference a Day Makes" (under three minutes) by Sarah Vaughn.  A YouTube link will be provided here soon so that we can all learn the choreography in time for the Burn.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions! 

We'll be performing near "The Pier" art installation on Thursday at 4pm. Those who arrive first will begin a spiral formation and those who join in will keep adding themselves to the spiral. Please arrive fifteen minutes early to get in position.

This is also an open mic to show off your creative side.  Song? Dance? Performance?  Bring it.  There will be sign up sheets at the campsite prior to the event day for you to join in.  If  you're late for your slot, we'll go down the line, and you can re-add yourself to the end if there's room.  All are welcome to join in on the fun, contributing your creativity, or just sitting back to enjoy the show.

This performance was inspired by and arranged from the Japanese traditional tea ceremony. The original ceremony consists of a variety of manners to drink, but to experience this fully, please drink with a style you favor most. The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. 

I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make better and more enjoyable future throughout this tea ceremony. 

Furthermore, I will do something interesting in San Francisco before Burning Man this year. Please join us if you have time before you head to the playa For more detail, please visit the following links.

flowery swim caps and nose plugs! The song: "What a Difference a Day Makes"

Please feel free to contact me with any questions! We'll be performing near "The Pier" art installation on Thursday at 4pm. Those who arrive first will begin a spiral formation and those who join in will keep adding themselves to the spiral.

Please arrive fifteen minutes early to get in position. Tell your friends! We

“I saw you all at Wanderlust and WOW, amazing performance. The ancient Bards and Muses were frolicking in the etherworlds above and below you in unison to your performance.” - John Marosi

“My expectations were exceeded! The Shimmy Sisters combined with Danyavaad, make up what is by far the best Middle Eastern influenced ensemble I have ever experienced.”
- San Diego Beach Life Magazine

“A Spiritually Rockin Journey! The full house included everyone from your all American dad with his two 10 year old daughters, to Burners and internationally known dancers, to local musicians. With standing room only, people sat on the floor, and stood between tables and chairs and by the end, the entire crowd was dancing along with them! A man in the audience said ‘it feels like I am being taken back into an ancient past ... into my nomadic past life.’ ”- The Papyrus

“Everyone was mesmerized by the sight. On stage, the beautiful Shimmy Sisters bellydanced and balanced long, sleek swords on their heads while leaning back into a somewhat contorted position. The members of Danyavaad closed their eyes and sank into the Middle Eastern-fusion music they were making, and with the skilled DJ Sandbag on bass, Gabriel Penix on dumbek and Greg Vaughan on electric sitar.”
- Kinsee Morlan of the San Diego CityBeat

“The Shimmy Sisters and Danyavaad captivated the crowd with enticing movements set to hypnotic rhythms. The belly-dancing Shimmy Sisters produced a stunning visual delight with twirling skirts intermingling with multiple colored scarves to become living, moving art. The sisters’ concentration, flexibility and control were evident as they, with flaming swords balance on their heads, stretched and twisted eliciting applause from the audience.“ - Elizabeth Guiten of the Imperial Beach Eagle & Times</p>

These ancient sounds bring our body, mind and spirit into its’ natural resonant frequency. Vibrations are able to pass through our body, removing internal clutter and allowing our minds to clear from the constant chatter. The relaxing tones invoke blissful enlightened states and sensations of weightlessness, opening, flying and floating.</p>

        <p class="description">"It’s not every day that a club owner sets his bar on fire to celebrate a great performance from a visiting band, but that’s just what happened when The BTB rocked the Isla Cantina. As the band dove into the Burning Man-themed crowd favorite “Gasoline,” a row of flame whipped across the top of the bar.
“We were firing on all cylinders that night,” says singer & guitarist Brian Travis. “The place was packed & we were charged up. Our best shows don’t just rely on execution. They happen when we’re playing with great energy and the kind of momentum that pushes rock 'n roll forward, tapping into the spirit of the music itself.”
Travis, Mark Wickliffe (drums) & Steve Wiel (bass) effortlessly mix classic rock with twangs of country & hints of the blues, giving traditional folk melodies a unique rock and roll vibe. With 5 albums of original content released, the core group of Travis, Wickliffe & Wiel continues to wow Los Angeles crowds with their own brand of heartfelt rock n roll.
“The BTB show is real,” says Wiel. ” There is nothing staged, nothing scripted, hell, sometimes we don’t even have a setlist. Each show is like no other & you never know what’s going to happen.”
The BTB has worked hard to earn its place as a Los Angeles mainstay, & with plans for future material & an upcoming tour already in the works, the band won’t be taking a break anytime soon. There is simply too much burning passion in the band’s driven frontman. “We’re exploring all these different sides of ourselves right now,” Travis explains. “We’re planning to record an album with the country sound we’ve been exploring lately. But after that, we’re going to get back to the rock stuff– because that’s truly what’s in my heart.” - Erin Johnson, June 2010</p>

Composer and producer Jim Genaro weaves together a rich tapestry of sounds, drawing influences from psychedelic trance and house music, but also from industrial, world beat, progressive rock, and even classical roots. LOGOS takes the energy and sounds of the dance floor and layers them with complex harmonies and melodies that send the listener on a journey into new sonic dimensions.</p>

Don't be scared. A little musical train wreck is inevitable but survivable. If you suck, we'll just kick you off and let someone who can groove get on. I we suck, my deepest apologies but we can make it through together!

We wanna celebrate and jam and listen and dance to the grotesque amount of musical talent that gathers on the playa. All performers are welcome. We will have a rigging point up for aerial arts.

DJ's jamming with guitar, bass, drums, keys, singers, cellos, accordions, kazoos, fiddles, bassoons and baboons. It's like the "I have a dream" speech but with instruments! the MOOPsquad will be with us, drinks will be available...

I am a little worried that some things are going to get a little out of hand.... but that's what we all came for, isn't it?

The first blurry ebbs & flows of life in protective space, growing with the beat of our initial life source. Painfully but beautifully, our space transforms & we enter the world. A tremendous, grounding grandeur marks our arrival & the rhythm of life begins. As we seek expression, understanding & movement, we drift in an emotional but transient phase & succumb to the flow of life. Eventually we discover our 'voice' & finding contentment in the language of music, our simultaneous sameness & uniqueness is revealed. Seeking transcendence, we push the boundaries of experience, towards the inevitable & incredible transformation which marks the often sombre, but ultimately celebratory end/beginning.</p>

        <p class="description">Glass Camp is a highly interactive project. Glass blowing is a mesmerizing art in itself. While it’s an art form dating backing to the birth of humanity, it’s still relatively new in the United States. The glow of a molten, honey-like material at night is hypnotic. The radiant heat of the equipment illuminating the hot shop floor is an installation in itself. Glass is a dance, with each team developing its own choreography. We intend to include the audience with ‘You Name It, We Make It’ activities. People can submit a design and our collection of talented artists will assemble what was not thought possible. Our team consists of some of the most skilled emerging and established artists in Seattle, the mecca for glass working in the world. Each night the team will take at least 2 complex designs from the audience and take the 2-D drawing and pull the 3-D design from the hot glass. There is no limit to what can be achieved in glass, and that’s what we intend to show. Glass blowing began in the Fertile Crescent and we hope to take it to Fertility 2.0. These professional artists are encyclopedias of information to anything relating to glass and high temperatures. With the making of glass, questions always arise, and we are equipped with the information to help people understand. All of our equipment was handmade by Evan Schuass, and was used last year in the Keyhole. Mobile glass studios are an excellent display of design, function, and efficiently. He has been commissioned from people all over the West Coast, and Hawaii to build these mobile shops. All the people included in Glass Camp are either producing artists or assistants to the highest level of glass workers in the world. We would like to share our gift and knowledge with the people of Burning Man. Everyone in this camp is here because they have a passion for glass art.</p>

Mamawitz will be providing delicious cookies, milk, (maybe even a bagel!) and lots of love and caring for Burners requiring a little TLC - in English, Hebrew, French, and/or Spanish. The 2009 version of this event won the Acculturation Video award from Burning Man (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtX8Z-izffs\). As Mamawitz says, "everyone needs motherly advice, but who wants to hear it from their own mother?...oy, too much baggage!"

It's what pushes people to the point of insanity; that unexplainable quality that pulls people to the dark side. Some days, Dark Sparkle is your alter-ego; other days it is your most natural feeling form. Dark Sparkle is Mona Lisa's smile, biscuits and gravy, the Fonz, the apocalypse. It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace.

Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease. Featuring Nicki Sparxx! Father Figure! Roxy Pop! La Chispa! Red Siren! StraighNasty! and many more. We'll also turn the tables with ample opportunity for participation.</p>

The Hang, a U.F.O. looking instrument, was created in 2000, by Felix and Sabina, the Hang makers, in Bern, Switzerland. This remarkable instrument sounds like the celestial orbs, a harp, or what have you. As the primary instrument of sonic creation for Prateado, collaboration with some of the top live and electronic artists on the west coast bring an array of listening and movement experiences.

Prateado is currently based in Los Angeles, though finds home anywhere in the world, especially San Francisco, Berlin, and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

The Salon is a night of creative expression. Our community started hosting salons in January 2010 as a safe space for the folks of Synchronicity and our friends to share finished or unfinished works of art, poetry, song, or any form of creative release.  The idea was to encourage people in the community to create, share, and hear thoughts or ideas from fellow creative souls.  It has since expanded, and we have enjoyed works of musicians, poets, storytellers, palindromists, historians, novelists, ramblers, gamblers, painters, filmmakers, drunks, fathers, mothers, lovers, dreamers, and psychedelic clowns from all over this land!
A crowd of lovely folks from across the playa will be gathering at 7.30 pm in preparation for the night's event.  A list will be roaming around, with 20 spots to fill. As 8 pm nears, we pile in front of our stage and are greeted by the lovely host of the evening.  From there.. anything goes!</p>

        <p class="description">Instead of singing popular songs in front of a live audience, act out scenes from popular movies! What kind of movies? Romances, of course!

Here’s how it works: come by and just watch if you like. Then if you decide you’d like to participate throw your name into one or more of the following hats: “straight male, straight female, gay male, or lesbian female.” When it’s time for a new scene we will decide whether it’s straight, gay, or lesbian (based on interest) and draw two names out of the appropriate hat(s) to determine who from the audience will play the two romantic leads. Then we will view a scene from a romance movie, “the kiss”, the scene in the movie where the leads “connect.”

After viewing this scene, our Baggage Check film director will direct the two randomly selected volunteers from the audience in recreating this scene, acting out the roles of the romantic leads, while our film crew captures the moment. For example, we might announce that the next scene will be a straight scene and we'd draw names from the straight male and straight female hats. Then we'd announce the movie as, for example, African Queen, and the man and woman selected would play the roles of Humphrey Bogart and Kathrine Hepburn. We would watch the scene on the boat when they've just successfully run the rapids and they kiss for the first time. Then the chosen actors would act out that scene.

Then while we repeat this process for more scenes we will edit the results of earlier scenes so that we can view them later in the evening, as they are edited.</p>

        <p class="description">Real, live music from kick ass rockers. Thursday-Saturday, 4-7P & 9P-12A. "Life is too damn short for crappy music."  Come dance your ass off with Greg and Doug, the organic jukebox duo from the Great White North.  These guys know rock: with a mental catalogue of over 3,000 tracks, they can move the crowd like Jagger.

Star Star Roadhouse is a destination… a local joint for wayward Burners looking for something different.  Here you can catch a live show: classic rock, moody blues or bluegrass… a rare experience at Burning Man. The sound system will be modest: what you'd expect to find at a honky tonk venue with live music.  Shows will be twice daily from 4-7, and 9-midnight, with an occasional after hours exception. We will be collaborating with many promoters on playa to book a variety of live bands. Yoga & dance classes will also be offered.

The stage will be decked out in classic Americana and vintage California-Nevada highway stylings, with colorful lighting, a sun bleached facade, shaded dance floor and lounge area with comfortable seating. Billiards and darts provide additional play and other interactive games are in the plans.

For added excitement and a visually stunning art experience, Artist Jamie Vaida & Crew are building the Fertility Twin mutant vehicles with indirect LED lighting, flame effects, and audio. They will either be parked near the stage or out rocking the playa with classic tunes transporting participants physically and musically.

We believe that the live music experience is unique and often absent at Burning Man and “Star Star Roadhouse” would be thrilled to offer it to the community.</p>

A 'Yes' RSVP is non-binding but will help us get the word out about the event. Join us for a short while or for the entire 2 hours. Performers will rotate throughout the night, so even when more than 25 show up, you will certainly get a turn!

We will have 25 luminous floating jellies for the performance. Just look for the glowing jellyfish in front of Disorient (3:30 and Esplanade) at/around 10pm on Wednesday night. From there we will float & sway and bring wonder to the night playa inhabitants. No jellyfish experience required. 

Billion Jelly Bloom is a Burning Man 2011 art project that undulates + articulates a luminous jellyfish bloom through the night playa. Our mobile performance jellyfish sculptures attract + invoke spontaneous human-jelly playa encounters.

A washed-up barren land where nothing grows, where all is arid and plain. Not a morsel to eat or a drop to be drunk. A scurvy crew of renegades have survived but what is their fate? Surely some revelation is at hand; Surely the Second Coming is at hand.
 
Join us on our theatrical journey to the New World. Look out for the white mast of the SS Serpent Queen, steaming across the esplanade from sundown, Thursday.

Whether the feedback is relatively minor (after dinner a friend mentions that you've left a tip that is too small) to major (a parent expresses disapproval with your choice of partner), it often takes us by surprise. At some point, we've probably all wished we had reacted differently in a feedback situation. To get a do-over, a second chance, a fresh start - a replay!
 
And now you can! Stop by and choose from our menu of feedback scenarios. We'll act out the scene, then you're invited to imagine alternative strategies to improve the experience for the feedback giver or receiver. Join us on stage to put your ideas in action, or give us instructions for the replay. At our Replay Cafe, we serve fresh feedback your way!</p>

        <p class="description">Dr. Notorious is a singer-songwriter of blues-rock songs. His songs are very rhythmic with lyrics that are not entirely unwise, occasionally are salacious, and sometimes a little stupid too (The Dr. keeps striving). He writes songs, he sings, he plays guitar, he plays harmonica, and, if you buy him a drink, he may even dance for you (or with you, it depends).

After a recent performance by the Dr., a wise and quite discerning new fan told him “Your music was just as I had hoped: inspiring, energetic, heartfelt, and fun, and it got people moving.” Fun and it woke people up? Mission accomplished! Deep stuff too? Will wonders never cease?!</p>

        <p class="description">The Naked Comedy Showcase is the creation of Andy Ofiesh, a stand-up comedian from Boston, Massachusetts. For years Andy has organized hosted naked comedy shows featuring Boston area comics doing stand-up in the nude. Andy's first naked comedy show in a public venue was at Improv Boston this past summer days before going to the Edinburgh Fringe in August. News of the event spread quickly and preceded his arrival in Edinburgh.

"A group of American comics have performed what could be the world's first naked stand-up show. The little-publicised event in Boston on Tuesday night was a sell-out."
— Chortle

After arriving in Scotland for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Andy seized an opportunity at Spank!, the late night comedy showcase at Smirnoff Underbelly, to do a 1 minute naked promo for the show that he was performing in called Why Work?. The overwhelming positive response at the event prompted Andy to host his Naked Comedy Showcase in Edinburgh.

Encouraged by the success of the shows at Improv Boston and at The Fringe in Edinburgh, Andy has organized an ongoing monthly naked comedy show at Improv Boston. News of the show was reported in both of Boston's major newspapers:

"Once a month, [Andy] does onstage what most of us could only imagine in our worst nightmare: naked stand-up-comedy...What's more astonishing is that Ofiesh has persuaded other performers to try nude stand-up, too, and now hosts "the Naked Comedy Showcase" at Improv Boston the First Wednesday of every month."
— Nick Zaino, Boston Globe

"Spectators who appreciated the comedy seemed to outnumber those who may have simply wanted to see naked people."
— Sean L McCarthy, Boston Herald

Now for the first time the Naked Comedy Showcase can be seen at Burning Man!!!</p>

        <p class="description">The 48 Hour Film Project is a wild opportunity in which you and a team make a movie—write, shoot, edit and score it—in just 48 hours. At the kickoff, you get a character, a prop, a line of dialogue, and a genre, all to include in your movie. 48 hours later, the movie must be complete. Then it will be shown at our "On the Red Carpet Premiere" on Thursday evening, August 30th at 11 PM at our Playa Theater (with an Encore Show on Friday, August 31st at 10 PM). If you have a team and equipment, start at your leisure and follow the instructions on posters found at PlayaInfo and Videogasm (in Snowflake Village).  If you want to get people for your team or join a team, come on down to Videogasm at 8:15 and Edelweiss in Snowflake Village on Tuesday at 3pm. The 48 Hour Film Project's mission is to advance filmmaking and promote filmmakers. Through its festivals the Project encourages filmmakers and would-be filmmakers to get out there and make movies. The tight deadline of 48 hours puts the focus squarely on the filmmakers—emphasizing creativity and teamwork skills. While the time limit places an unusual restriction on the filmmakers, it is also liberating by putting an emphasis on "doing" instead of "talking."Note: Anyone making a video must first fill out a personal use form and get a camera tag from Media Mecca in Center Camp.</p>

This performance was inspired by and arranged from the Japanese traditional tea ceremony. The original ceremony consists of a variety of manners to drink, but to experience this fully, please simply drink with a style you favor most. The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make better and more enjoyable future throughout this tea ceremony. Furthermore, I will do something interesting in San Francisco before Burning Man this year. Please join us if you have time before you are headed for the playa For more detail, please visit the following links. Ken Hamazaki Red Museum http://www.kenhamazaki.jp/</p>

For our third incarnation the TBE~WaVe~ installation, our body~sonic dance platforms that afford participants a uniquely interactive experience to engage kinesthetically with the music, we are upping the visual ante with the addition of a 30ft. dome to our public frontage. This structure, which will be combined with our wave sculpture, will be curated by the visualist CINEMOEBA, who, as per his 2012 work, will once again be providing a wonderland of analog feedback & other projected delights. This in combination with our live fusion and  Dubstep centric line-up featuring some of the finest bass culture talent available on playa, denizens of Black Rock City can expect a fourth dimensional EXPERIENCE like no other. Come wobble the TBE~WaVe~ and challenge your perceptions of bass culture music from every learning and thinking modality. Discover the optimal conditions for proper bass culture appreciation, the facilitation of which is our primary mission. We are devoted to ensuring the Tsunami Bass well~spring of proper bass culture on playa is properly nurtured and celebrated at Burning Man. As the TBE Multiversity of Bass Culture Appreciation founders will preach, proper edutainment is our main goal.  We invite you to open your heart/mind and try a new "substance over style" attuned environment, carefully curated by bass culture artists (Established by the Tsunami Bass Experience's Morphous & ShiZaru) for artists & aficionados. This is not a "nightclub on playa" but rather a welcome respite for those seeking low-end frequency with the utmost decency... join us for a more intimate and holistically immersive esthetic environment in which you will experience a full range of frequencies, with the decibels enlightenly engineered properly. Line-up will be posted to the internets so find us!! ~Cheers!~}*{~ (BYOB, NO MOOP)</p>

Bring them to the Playa Sock Exchange (PSE) for a half hour of crazy sock trading. However, unlike Wall Street we ask that you don’t air your dirty laundry here, please bring clean socks (a little dusty is fine, just not stinky). You may bring singles or pairs and trade up or down with fellow traders. There will be a limited supply of IPO seed sock available for you to choose from if you find you are shorted of socks on arrival.  Trade once, trade twice, trade as many times as you want.  Trading ends when the final bell rings. Everyone comes out ahead, or afoot as the case may be.</p>

Yes,  Bobby Wheelock has finally worked out how to give back to every participant on the playa.  This will encompass delivering 64,000 unique flyers to everyone.  And we need YOU to help. --------

Upon taking this great privilege,  you will zig zag down the streets and give flyers to all participants - and these are not your normal flyers.  Each one is different, unique, and special.  There are jokes, puzzles, games, gags, and coupons, and ultimately a higher purpose - to make sure every burner gets the true value of decommodification.  These flyers are also very well organized so as to tell  participants everything they need to know - their new Playa name, color, home planet and more!
------
To participate,  Please wait at your most convenient corner on the outlying road of Laissez-faire on wednesday morning, and look for the mutant vehicle with a big Z on it. 
We will provide you with a bag full of a chunk of flyers, a map with directions, a official postal cap, and a second bag so you can collect all the gifts that are Deserved to you by the populace of Burning Man for your amazing volunteer effort.  The routes will be back and forth from each 1/2 hour street, moving inward from Laissez-faire to the Esplanade.
------
Help us with this amazing performance art project.  Help us ensure that Decommodification stays as a true principal!
------
Who is Bobby Wheelock?

Bobby is one of the earliest human clones.   Born in 1970,  he is duplicated from the DNA of a prominent German political leader.  That being said,  Bobby has veered away from his "father's" ways and wishes to bring love joy to the burning man community.</p>

        <p class="description">The soulful conviction of Eric Hayes floods his audience with a hearty stew of rich tones and silky vibes. Even those whose thirst is never quenched cannot help but set down their drink, close their eyes and give in to the seductive musings of this rising star. Hailing from New Jersey, Eric Hayes is so much more than your all-American musician. His music possesses a stirring, earthy sound that leaves his fans aching for more. His voice is robust. His talent is pure. His passion is unmatched.

The 31 year old Far Hills native and William Paterson University music graduate has been the recipient of several positive reviews by prestigious critics and has been featured in the Star Ledger, New York Village Voice Magazine, New York Post, the ASPCA and a host of online blogs and pop culture media sites.

Hayes' credits include collaborating and performing with several big name artists such as Gavin Degraw, Martin Sexton, Bill Withers, Rusted Root, Indie artist Rachel Platten, Reggae legend Ziggy Marley and soul artist Joss Stone.

2013 has been and continues to be an incredible year for Hayes. He is truly humbled by the invitation to perform and share his music at Burning Man 2013 on the night the "Man Burns" for Black Rock City and such an incredible community of artists.

Hayes is well known for his musical charity work and has headlined exclusive events held by some of the world’s most elite circles of hosts including the opening dinner ceremony for the United States Olympic Wrestling Team and headlining the internationally recognized American Giving Awards winning "More Than Me" charity. 
He is inspired by both male and female artists including Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Susan Tedeschi and Radio Head. Recently Hayes performed at the annual ASPCA fund raising charity event, attracting more than 15,000 people, during which he reportedly helped friend and animal advocate Prince Lorenzo Borghese raise more than $50,000 for animal welfare.</p>

We've got 10,000 watts of juicy sound, some of the best real estate in Black Rock City, and a nighttime crowd just waiting to be whipped into a frenzy. All you have to do is wow our panel of judges and you too could be headlining Burning Man! For this contest we hearken back to that seminal masterpiece of talent programs: The Gong Show. Perhaps you remember the cringe-worthy showcase of questionable performances that critics could halt by striking a loud gong. This event is eerily similar, only ours has balls. Ovaries too. Giant, dusty gonads. Can you hang? Instead of a gong, DJs will wear a shock collar and get buzzed off stage by volts of harsh rejection if they fail to impress. Instead of regaling us with tap dancing, DJs break out their most mind blowing tracks and slickest tricks. Instead of a paltry sum to commemorate victory, winners will be invited back during peak hours to pound the dance floor into submission. This is open decks for the fearless. Bring it.</p>

It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease. Featuring your favorite DS performers as well as guests from the BRC community. We'll also turn the tables with ample opportunity for participation. Contact: nickisparxx@gmail.com</p>

Lexington, Kentucky artists Kurt and Kremena in participation with Kentucky Fried Camp present the natural extension of the Lexington Tattoo Project. We will show the documentary of the Lexington Tattoo Project, premiere the new poem and video intro for the new global project that will allow participants worldwide to join in to have parts of the poem and image tattooed and filmed. Many folks in Lexington had the first ink ever as part of this incredibly popular and successful work and this plans to be much bigger and scope and reach. Check it out. More info and links on http://kurtandkremena.com/
The Kentucky Fried Cotillion will begin immediately after in the center of the plaza.</p>

When our monkey mind is fully engaged, our thoughts dance in and among the embodied experience we are having.  In this lab we will embrace our monkey mind and bring our soft focus to these thoughts. We will dip in and out of solos, duets, and group dances, taking time to reflect, journal, and discuss our mind's dance, and discover the pathway to underlying beliefs that hold these thought patterns in place. Once these are revealed, will we find commonality in our thought patterns? What will these beliefs point to regarding our lives off the dance floor?</p>

While we can’t escape the loud dance music in the morning, NYC director/composer Charlie Dayburn composed a 7-track Original cinematic soundtrack to accompany dayburners like us who are seeking solitude at the dawn of the day. The 7 tracks express 7 roller coaster feelings throughout the week. Charlie Dayburn would like to share the whole album with fellow dayburners through 7 different connection exercises from body contact to soul gazing. This album is also tuned to 432Hz which believes it's the vibrational frequency of our human bodies. It's an more inward experience that is felt inside the body at the spine and heart. Each attendee will receive a copy of the album.</p>

The 25 minute piece includes audience lead group song and the sharing of personal intentions of Love. Embrace Pas de Deux features Sierra Nevada Ballet principal dancers Ananda Bena-Weber and Alexander Biber.

The 2009 version of this event won the Acculturation Video award from Burning Man (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtX8Z-izffs\).  As Mama Lisa says, "everyone needs motherly advice, but who wants to hear if from their own mother?...oy, too much baggage!"

No person shall go uncostumed or unfabulous because we have a full team of costume stylists ready to dress you up and help you transform. The only thing we ask of you is a proud strut down our runway to display your new duds to booty moving music. If you prefer a DIY approach, step inside our Krafting Dome where you can gain the supplies and know-how to upgrade your bike and your look. Our professional staff knows their way around a glue gun and we're not afraid to bedazzle YOU! The playa provides the grit, we supply the glamour so hop the K Train to costume transformations, music and a non stop runway show that would make RuPaul blush. Of course the city never sleeps and our amazing DJ line up keeps us moving into the night as the city lights shine bright into the dark playa night. Also not to be missed is the Peepshow FreaKKshow, BRC's only 24 hour participatory peep show where you can be the star or simply sneak a peek at some Big Apples! Down our alleys you will find costumes, crafting, sparkle pony vagrants, playa hustlers, burner working gals and street wise tramps.

        <p class="description">Open day & night to peeper and peepees, Times Square Peepshow has the hot bodies on playa. What will your inner peepshow performer do?

Kostume Kult recreates the glory days of NYC circa the 1970's by transporting you to the seedy throwback replica of "Times Square BRC". The Empire State Building and 25ft King Kong loom above the NYC skyline while a runway show that blows fashion week out of the dust goes on street level starring you. As a premiere daytime destination, Kostume Kult will be providing costume transformations to the under-accessorized masses of BRC. No person shall go uncostumed or unfabulous because we have a full team of costume stylists ready to dress you up and help you transform. The only thing we ask of you is a proud strut down our runway to display your new duds to booty moving music. If you prefer a DIY approach, step inside our Krafting Dome where you can gain the supplies and know-how to upgrade your bike and your look. Our professional staff knows their way around a glue gun and we're not afraid to bedazzle YOU! The playa provides the grit, we supply the glamour so hop the K Train to costume transformations, music and a non stop runway show that would make RuPaul blush. Of course the city never sleeps and our amazing DJ line up keeps us moving into the night as the city lights shine bright into the dark playa night. Also not to be missed is the Peepshow FreaKKshow, BRC's only 24 hour participatory peep show where you can be the star or simply sneak a peek at some Big Apples! Down our alleys you will find costumes, crafting, sparkle pony vagrants, playa hustlers, burner working gals and street wise tramps. You won't want to miss it so jump the turnstile to the KKrossroads Of The World. After all if you can make it here you can make it anywhere!</p>

NYC director/composer Dayburn (Charlie Wan) will be performing his original cinematic score at Black Rock Observatory (designed by 2013 Temple designer Gregg Fleishman) to accompany your deep connecting moment with the most important star in our universe - the Sun. There will be live visual projection of the sun from solar telescope by astrophysicist Matt O'Dowd. Any art cars with sound systems and FM radio receivers are welcomed to participate our additional immersive simulcast soundscape experience. There will be a small numbers of radio receivers available to be borrowed at the event. The concert starts at the first ray of light on friday morning (August 29, 6am).

        <p class="description">During Burning Man 2013 I looked up at the sky on Wednesday night and saw only the very brightest of stars with the great majority of them washed out by the lights of our city in the desert.

I contrasted this in my mind with the first year I came to the play and "Instead of going to sleep I sat in the door of my tent and just let the 
glorious light of ALL THOSE STARS wash over me. I could hold my hand out and see a clear shadow on the cracked and fizzured playa, from the stars alone."

Our art project for Burning Man 2014 will be to enlist the active cooperation of approximately 68 thousand other burners as "co-artists" with Creation to turn every non-essential light in the city OFF for two hours on the night of Wednesday, August 27th from 11pm to 1am on the 28th.

Then, everyone can look up and share with me the wonder of our sky there at Black Rock City which most have never seen. To borrow a phrase we'll all be able to "take a trip and never leave the farm."

We may not succeed fully or at all but it's fun and cheap to try : ).</p>

        <p class="description">This is a theatrical performance contrasting religion and spirituality throughout history, and showing how atheists and theists need each other to avoid the pitfalls of religious fundamentalism. The spirituality embedded in religious texts is universal and profound, and has been of great benefit to society, but the undisciplined psychology of human beings leads to its oversimplification and use as a tool to control others. Atheists today are in a unique position to support critical thinking within a religious society that often condemns it.</p>

        <p class="description">This action art work utilizes BUTOH-inspired movement to envision an inert, architectural column, carved in the shape of a woman, come to life.  Three sound tracks demonstrate the Kuleshov effect. Viewers will discover various interpretations of the movement with three different soundtracks, or observe the piece utilizing the haptic, environmental soundscape of the performance space.

This short piece is structured in three parts. The first part  serves as an awakening, as the caryatid discovers movement from the perch of the entablature onto which it is mounted.  The second part captures the caryatid’s realization of increased mobility, and the expansion of  its sensate environment.  The third part chronicles the caryatid’s awareness of its limitations, and the slow recognition of its inevitable embrace back to its native form.

SlaveMart is an interactive performance piece that celebrates the little known 11th Principle, “Radical Self Enslavement” (sometimes known as DIY Brainwashing).
One can relax at our Tea and Slaves Shoppe and have some teas of a dubious nature while being served by beautiful slave drivers. When the time is right ten lucky volunteer enslavees will be marched up to the cat walk and be auctioned off. But this is no ordinary auction. In this one, the merchandise is king and can pick and choose among the myriad offers of the crowd below. Bids can be a ride in an art car, foot massage or perhaps the best martini on the playa. When a suitable exchange has been agreed upon the slightly deranged Auctioneer hammers the bid to a close and Slaver and Slavee go off on a one-hour adventure that is mutually enjoyable for both. And both get necklaces to boot.</p>

I named myself Hechi-Ken after the legendary master of tea ceremony, Hechi-Kan. The original ceremony consists of a variety of manners to drink, but to experience this fully, please simply drink with a style you favor most. The most interesting practice would be turning your thought toward him for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make better and more enjoyable future throughout this tea ceremony.</p>

It's what pushes people to the point of insanity; that unexplainable quality that pulls people to the dark side. Some days, Dark Sparkle is your alter-ego; other days it is your most natural feeling form. Dark Sparkle is Mona Lisa's smile, biscuits and gravy, the Fonz, the apocalypse. It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease. Featuring your favorite DS performers as well as guests from the BRC community. We'll also turn the tables with ample opportunity for participation. Contact: srodenburg@gmail.com</p>

Come and join us on the Silicon Village stage for a group reading of the funniest and most terrible pieces of fan fiction ever produced... 'The Eye of Argon." Bear witness to the near impossible to read dialogue without bursting into laughter as other readers and members of the audience act out the scenes from this story regardless of inconsistencies, spelling errors, grammar errors, capitalization errors, tense errors, and made up words that make no sense! Do you have the stomach for dialogue such as this?

"The vile stench of the Shaman's hot fetid breath over came the nauseated female with a deep soul searing sickness, causing her to wrench her head backwards and regurgitate a slimy, orange white stream of swelling gore over the richly woven purple robe of the enthused acolyte."

If so come to the reading of the "Eye of Argon" written 35 years ago and has yet to be forgotten in the sands of time. The dialogue may seem impossible, but the terrible show will go on!</p>

        <p class="description">We will be opening up our main stage to the citizens of Black Rock City to use our venue for performances of all kinds: juggling, poetry, music, comedy, stand-up, etc. A sound system will be made available including microphones. We ask that you come by before the event and sign up for a time block of 15 minutes. We can do larger blocks depending on how many people wish to use our stage. It is a first come first serve basis. You are welcome to hang out in the audience and watch or on standby if someone doesn't show.  Send an email to Stage@SiliconVillageBurners.org with questions or to schedule.</p>

Exit through the gift shop onto the runway where burners strut their newfound finery rebirthed onto the playa - ready to participate with extra attitude. From the raised dance platform watch the daily fashion shows and ongoing esplanade carnival. Loved by the paparazzi and Cheered on by subway straphangers, live DJ music, and the infamous ring master MCs, citizens can show their freaky side on the runway under the watchful eye of the 25' tall King Kong. Hanging from the Empire State Building, even Kong gets his freakshow on with his Guinness World Record 45' pink tutu (Tutu Tuesday) and BRC Animal Control bling.</p>

        <p class="description">From the opening moments, we learn this solo show is about soul mates, and the search for love and lust. Emily is the hero of the story, a character very much a literary stand-in for author and performer Eleanor O’Brien. We meet her as a child, fascinated by romance novels and her father’s porn. The show traces her journey from awkward teen to college boyfriends, complete with disappointing first times and disastrous blowjobs. But then she discovers renown sex-columnist Dan Savage, her ‘gay fairy godfather’. Dan helps her learn to ask for what she wants (“I can touch my own clit during sex?”), and encourages her to be GGG (Good, Giving and Game). Emily goes on a spree of experimentation, culminating in the “grand prix of getting lucky,” Burning Man. At the world’s largest alternative event, she meets Matt, who turns out to be the love of her life-but he doesn’t identify as monogamous. Can they make it work? Emily asks Dan for advice as they navigate the thrills and valleys of opening the relationship: how to negotiate boundaries, deal with jealousy and keep from falling in love with other people. She thinks if they follow the rules they've set, they can keep their relationship safe. They can be “monogamish,” and keep the spark in their marriage. When a magical threesome drives her to utter meltdown, Emily insists on closing their marriage. But monogamy doesn’t solve all their problems. Emily and Matt discover they have different libidos - and the seven-year itch isn’t a myth. He encourages her to spread her wings, so she takes a lover. All's fine for a while, but soon she finds herself falling in love with Michael, her NSA partner for play. She is terrified of losing her marriage to Matt, and asks Dan again for advice. “Is polyamory a utopian ideal?” During an ayahuasca ceremony, Emily finally sees where she's been blind to how her behavior has stifled her marriage, and how she has to let go of the need for certainty, or controlling anyone else’s heart.</p>

He is known for his supernatural vocal range and utilization of homemade instruments and found sounds to create sonic tapestries of layered vocal samples and unconventional instrumentation. His performances often feature an construct of self-made visual art pieces inspired by personal and cultural archetypes, a continual thread woven throughout his performance aesthetic.
SORNE performs and tours with a revolving cast of dancers, musicians and artists while working with local communities of peoples around the world to create unique participatory live experiences of his work, thus blurring the line between performer and audience member.  His musical style has been described as a combination of tribal, electronica, avant-garde, avant pop, alternative rock, and opera.</p>

In Actoroke, you and a friend pick a scene from a popular movie to act out. We will have a full film crew setup, complete with 3 cameras (wide master, and one on each actor), wireless lapel mics for each actor, 2 teleprompters (one for each actor, in their eye line), and a truss and lighting setup.

You will be directed by our camp’s filmmaker, Hoss Hitchcock, who will help you through your performance. Come get the full experience of acting and being directed.

The video feeds from all three cameras will be displayed in the “video village” where your friends and strangers can watch your performance!

If this sounds fun but you don’t want to act, then try your hand at running a camera or teleprompter!

Utilizing our Movie Mirror Obscura technology, what wast once restricted to the dark isolation of a head-sized box or a stuffy, lightless chamber, is anon a shared, open-air experience under the stars themselves. Thrill to see actual, illuminate images of people, places, and things (things!!!) that seem to move with a divine direction of their own making.

Leonardo daVinci was himself taken with the possibilities of the Camera Obscura. Inspired, Liminal Labs Workshop does the Master one better by adding focused, intense illumination on a 53-foot white wall to offer an experience beyond what even Leonardo might imagine.

Indeed, the Movie Mirror Obscura dual screen system shines brighter than the heavens and is blended with sounds to tempt the dancing angels. From Tuesda through Friday, each evening’s dark of night brings, not one, but two images magically mirrored, side-by-side for thy Royal amusement. Prithee shaketh thy booty if so moved. Or sit and enjoy the movie magic.</p>

The most interesting practice would be turning your thoughts inward for a few minutes without speaking and enjoy drinking in this small silent space. I always serve this tea for whoever sits down in front of me. Red Tea Ceremony -YOU ARE GOD- is always a great tool to communicate universally without any thought of hierarchy. I'll be happy if we could find any great idea to make a brighter, better, and more enjoyable future through this tea ceremony.</p>

        <p class="description">Indigenous people across the globe have used sacred plant medicines for millennia to heal, illuminate and connect them to the web of life. Each of these psychoactive medicines needs a healer to connect them to their patients: the shaman. This investigative-adventure documentary show examines not just these shamanic medicines, but the shamans that wield them. If, as Marshall McLuhan said, we are now a “global village”, then we need our own healers that understand the deep power and sacredness these plant medicines can reveal.  Film screening followed by Filmmakers Q&A session.</p>

        <p class="description">Reverbia presents for the first time our Reverbia Interactive Live Music Art Wall Mural!  As our Live Music resonates through your ears, share your depths of perspective and emotion through the iterative expression of Art Wall Painting. Noted Canadian artist Danielle Caners, leads an expedition into the realms of unknown, improvised art, where only through the collective creative mind, can a masterpiece be discovered.  Daily and nightly, when the live music is playing, come share your artistic expression by painting upon our mural canvas wall.  Portions of Reverbia's Art Wall Mural will be painting between established lines, while other areas of the Art Wall Mural will be free formed expression.  *Note that the Reverbia Art Wall Mural will not be open 24 hours…but will operate throughout the day and night whenever our artist supervision  is available.  During Reverbia's concerts in the Shade Series and Reverbia Live Nights…the Art Wall Mural will be the most consistently available for public painting and expression.</p>

        <p class="description">Videogasm will again be host to The Black Rock City edition of The 48 Hour Film Project. Were groups of burners write, shoot and edit films over a 48 hour period to be shown at a festival on Thursday night. We'll start with a retrospective of short films produced at Burning Man in previous years and then premiere the shorts that will be produced at this years Burning Man!

Filmmakers: If you have a team and equipment, start at your leisure and follow the instructions on posters found at PlayaInfo and Videogasm (in Snowflake Village). If you're looking to form a team come to Videogasm at 3pm on Tuesday (8/30) to meet up with other like minded individuals. Film's should be under 10 minutes in length, contain the three ingredients (character, prop & line of dialog) listed on the posters mentioned above, and be brought to Videogasm by 8pm on Thursday (9/1). You can now shoot and edit a film on your smart phone, so get out there and make a film!</p>

Reverbia's location on the Esplanade affords beautiful views of art and desert mountains…in a neighborhood where live music is respected by all thumping DJs…a place where you can actually hear the delicate of string and woodwind. This could be your chance to rekindle relationships, court a Burner for a first date, or just connect with good friends and family…perhaps even a sunset of self appreciation and silence...except for the music of Mozart and Debussy.  Enjoy your best wine…and maybe some light dinner along with that nice slice of Cheesecake you have been saving in the RV.  Manet's "Dejeuner sur l'Herbe"...BRC Sunset style!

It's what pushes people to the point of insanity; that unexplainable quality that pulls people to the dark side. Some days, Dark Sparkle is your alter-ego; other days it is your most natural feeling form. Dark Sparkle is Mona Lisa's smile, biscuits and gravy, the Fonz, the apocalypse. It is an adventurous way of life--physically, emotionally and mentally that citizens of BRC embrace. Our shows are an opportunity for Dark Sparklers and other BRC citizens to explore and showcase their Dark Sparkle through performance, storytelling, and tease. Featuring your favorite DS performers as well as guests from the BRC community. We'll also turn the tables with ample opportunity for participation.</p>

Scores are given to one decimal point (e.g. 5.4, not 5.48). A single score is given to each air guitarist based on their overall performance in that round.

The score reflects the quality of the performance based on three key criteria:

1.	Technical merit - You don’t have to know what notes you’re playing, but the more your invisible fretwork corresponds to the music that’s playing, the better the performance.
2.	Stage presence - Anyone can do it in the privacy of their bedroom. Few have what it takes to rock a crowd of hundreds or even thousands – all without an instrument.
3.	“Airness” - The last criteria is the most difficult to define yet often the most decisive of all. Airness is defined as the extent to which a performance transcends the imitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself.

Please note: the scores from BOTH ROUNDS are added to determine the contestants’ final scores. This combined score determines the winner.  Earn the title of Black Rock City Air Guitar Champion!</p>

Thompson to free a young woman from prison for a crime she obviously did not commit. This talk illuminates another side of the author as an activist--not about the guns and drugs. This is an educational talk about why America should abolish the Felony Murder statue which can hold people accountable for crimes they had no intention of committing.

        <p class="description">Experience live music the Savage way - in 3D!!! Music Savages Camp is excited to transport you to the future - where the beats and sounds and rhythms will come from all dimensions. The Savage Arena is outfitted with 16 speakers, mounted around the perimeter and above the dance floor - all facing inward. And at the center, our performers will take control of their music, sending sounds to all reaches of space. 

Are those crickets on the playa??? No... bugs were so last year. Is that a train coming through my tent??? No.. while we would like to make a train, the tracks could be problematic for bikers without headlamps. Is that a spaceship landing in a daybed??? maybe... but you're probably just hearing things from the future... SAVAGE 3D. It's here. 

Oh.. and we have cool lights.</p>

Hollywood, that since we are kids and throughout our entire life feeds us with happy endings that inevitably evolve around a couple finally being together. In the past few years, though, it seems like Hollywood is considering nontraditional relationships as well. Can we trust the studios, or should we question them?</p>

There are as many gods as there are questions in our hearts, and any exploration yields questions.</p>

This led some of us to wonder whether Burning Man was "gentrifying" to some degree; becoming less inclusive of low-income participants due to cost or other factors. We hope to present data and discuss conclusions from what we know thus far.</p>

It’s a very theatrical and mysterious magic show full of unexplainable transformations, levitation, appearances, mind reading and magical manipulations with fire, cards, books, articles of clothing, and other objects. All of the effects will be happening very close to our audience, and often right in their hands. 
Followed by "Danceburg" - a dance troupe with beautifully choreographed dances (Argentine tango, waltz, cha-cha, salsa, folk, hip-hop, freestyle and other styles of dances.) The performances will be shown the camp's Big Dome.</p>
