One at a time, individuals will be allowed to engage the Living Piñata in traditional piñata-combat--involving padded bats. 

Just as with a traditional piñata, if people strike the Living Piñata's body hard enough, treasures will 'bleed' forth. 

But unlike a traditional piñata, people will have to strike with care, because THIS TIME the Piñata will ALSO be armed with a padded bat--with which to exact its revenge! 

Behold--PIÑATA'S REVENGE!

In 2010 our 'Living Piñatas' will appear as Fritz-Lang-inspired robots from Metropolis. In this way the classic battle between Man and Piñata will come to symbolize the quintessential struggle of Modernity--between Man's natural and mechanical selves.</p>

        <p class="description">The Burning Man Ultramarathon will be a true test for the hardcore runners: in the desert, in the middle of the crazy, wonderful, hot, sandy, sweaty Burning Man festival, runners will face a series of loops around the perimeter, past The Man and The Temple, past various artwork, through part of the main camp of Burning Man to run 50 kilometers (31 miles). The race will take place on Wednesday, September 1st, starting at 5 a.m. (with mandatory race meeting at 4:45 a.m.).

Participants can attire themselves however they would like (the more entertaining, the better), but should wear running sneakers (or Vibrams, if that's how you roll), and MUST carry at least one bottle of water. There will be 2-3 aid stations with water and running snacks (and we welcome volunteers to help dispensing the water and assist the runners with cheers, hydration, snacks, and sweaty hugs -- please contact me if you'd like to volunteer!), and runners can leave drop bags at the main aid station. All finishers will receive finishers' medals and lots of love.

Please pass on this information to any runner you know. Volunteers and pacers are needed! We'll be having art cars along the course to spray people down. I anticipate most runners taking between four and eight hours to finish the run. People can contact me with any questions.</p>

        <p class="description">In the 5Rhythms we dance hard, we dance bold, we dance deep. Jonathan takes us to the place where the soul of hip hop, the catharsis of rock and roll, the trance of techno and the heart of house collide into the world beat. And in this beat, we get together to reinvent ourselves, to discard last week’s fears and move into this week’s dreams. This is our practice. It doesn’t matter where we come from or how we grew up or whether we can or can’t dance. Movement is medicine, and whether we feel clumsy or graceful, it heals us. Real learning happens when we show up and move because the body can’t lie. It lets us know right away if we’re feeling closed or open, fixed or fluid, tight or loose, off or on. We carry so many things, and not just in our backpacks. What do we do with all this repressed stuff, the headtrips that are holding us back, holding us down, and turning us into something we’re not? We dance. We dance with whatever’s going on inside of us and connect with others who are doing the same. Fueled by the ecstatic language of the 5Rhythms, this is movement as spiritual practice, a dancing, kinetic prayer of connection to the unpredictable mystery of it all.</p>

Get everyone in your camp to separate out your aluminum cans, bring them to Recycle Camp in Center Camp at 5:55 & the Inner Circle. We're right behind the Cafe.

When you arrive, a friendly Recycle Camp Volunteer will greet you and show you where to sort your cans. Once they're sorted, you get to ride the bicycle that powers The Blue Duck, our state of the Art aluminum can crushing machine. Or you can feed the machine your cans & watch them get crushed. After your cans are crushed, we'll show you where they go next.

Proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach School. Last year we were able to donate $1500 to the school. We want to thank all the participants of Black Rock City for helping to make this possible.</p>

This is not a gallery, it is more like juvenile detention for art, an orphanage, a half-way house for misfit art. All art in the Home is up for adoption, all the prospective new parent needs to do is fill out a small adoption form and clip it to the Home in place of their newfound art darling. Art may also be committed to the Home, just put it securely in place and say good-bye. While the emphasis is on visual art such as paintings, drawings and photos, sculptural art and trinkets found their way into the Home last year and then found new homes.</p>

Prints will be mailed a few weeks after the event, as I work in traditional emulsion based process. Everyone is welcome, including families with children.

The human form is art’s oldest and most persistent subject. Photography, perhaps the most documentarian of all art forms, is a particularly challenging medium for it. My approach is not to challenge photography’s inherent literalism but work within its framework.  My subjects are real people, who happen to be nude and whose nudity is neither contrived nor interactive. They don’t call for an action or elicit a particular response from the viewer.

I also hope that my images aren’t nudesploitation either:  the human form I strive for isn’t employed to talk about anything else whatsoever. Hence, I don’t work with professional models or in a studio. If you are interested in posing for this project, please come by.  

If you are interested in assisting, and are well versed in practice and theory of photography as an art medium, please get in touch.</p>

We all know that the eyes are the window of the soul. Are you walking around with the curtains to these windows closed to the world?

In this eye-opening workshop, you will learn the history and evolution of eye contact, and then you will receive practical instruction on how to improve the quality of your eye contact, with friends, loved ones, lovers, and even strangers, for fostering intimacy, connectedness, and trust. 

For the second half of the workshop, you will have the opportunity to experience for yourself the interconnectedness, trance, ego dissolution and ecstasy that can come from deep, prolonged gazing into another's eyes, as a meditative practice. Sages, yoginis, dakinis, mystics and poets throughout the ages--including Rumi--have seen eye gazing as one of the most powerful and subtly erotic experiences two humans can share. Come experience this power for yourself.</p>

The piano is fully functional (via electronic keyboard) and has a bench wrapping around one of its sides for musicians to sit on. Our intent is to around the playa, searching out musical, artistic, vocal, and spoken word collaborators, and creating dynamic collaborative music. We'd like to record some of these collaborations, and give mixed CDs out on playa on Sunday or via the Internet after the festival.

True to its name, the Wandering Hands Piano Bar is also a bar, so we invite those who would like to sit back and listen to the music to climb inside the piano into the central seating area and enjoy a fine concoction from our bartender.</p>

Over 1,000 Burners are featured answering, "Why do you do what you do?" on the playa. Burners have spread this meme around the world, prompting 10,000 people to answer the question. // The past few years, we've collaborated with a few dozen photographers and artists with different styles (including digital and video). These are presented in the exhibit on the back fence surrounding Center Camp. // If you want to collaborate as a photographer or a "conversationalist" sign up here: http://wdydwyd.com/bmshoot // This project a great way to meet new burners, participate in a collaborative art project as a photographer or as someone who is just interested in having meaningful conversations with fellow Burners about their passions and motivations. // Or, if you just want to have your portrait made for future exhibits on the playa, come double check the schedule on the exhibit for the most up-to-date times when collaborating photographers will be there.</p>

By Wednesday, for those of you that have been surviving on trail mix, melted chocolate bars, or completely forgot that food was an essential part of surviving in Black Rock City, the though of a home cooked cup of chili might sound pretty good.  It's worth the walk or ride over to "The Bust Stop" located at 8:15 and Hanoi (West Side).  Wednesday, at 4:00 PM we'll be serving up cups of our now highly popular Playafied Chili. Stop by but consider being a little early.  Last year 327 campers enjoyed our gift which is "First Come - First Serve".  We look forward to joining many of our old friends and meeting new ones.   (Nevada State Health Division temporary food permit will be on-site).</p>

It's Rock'Em Sock'Em Robots, from your youth, but this time they're big enough to knock *your* block off.  You climb into the boxing ring and climb into the Blue Bomber, and suddenly you've become an 8 foot tall robot fighting machine.  Your trusty companion grabs hold of the steering controls outside the ring, while your two combatants gear up in the Red Rocker.  The hot arena lights pound down on you while the crowd cheers you on.  You hear the bell ring, and the fight is on!</p>

Camp Beaverton for Wayward Girls is your queer oasis in BRC.  Join us for an old fashioned Lesbian Mixer in the dessert.  We will play our version of Spin the bottle which we call Spin the monkey.  Meet your future ex-playa girlfriend in a friendly, safe sexy space.  Our dome is women-identified 24/7. Bring your own cup. 


"Camp Beaverton: Camp for Wayward Girls" is an intentional (and experimental) Burning Man community camp AND conversation. For who? For Gay and Queer Women (identified), Dykes, Bykes, Sluts, Butches, Bois, Trannies, Lesbians, Geekster-Hip Lezzies, Lesbos, Lipstick Lesbians, the Bi-identified, the Bi-curious, the Hetero-flexible, and even (gasp!) the occasional Straight Girl (as long as she's as Wayward as the playa is dusty). We are thouroughly queer, yet inclusive, with a definite chick-centric bent. Participation, inquiry, conversation, and owning your stuff are the name of the game.

Our intention is to provide two things: a kick-ass Queer Oasis in Black Rock City for girls who LOVE girls, and a continuing conversation exploring female and feminine queer sexuality in the world and in BRC. Participatory in nature, Camp Beaverton, whether online or on the Playa, is a place where you are encouraged to explore YOUR expression of queerness and allow the rest of us to ask "What is MINE?"</p>

Joke telling is a huge part of our camp's experience and is integrated into our activities. With two large 30' tension tents, we have one that is high energy with music and a raging red sno-cone bar where people can laugh and play and another that is relaxing with cushions and chairs on the other side of camp where our guests can visit and get to know the people around them.

In addition we have a dodgeball court with multiple quirky themed games in a non-competitive friendly atmosphere.  Around camp there's a number of red self-tensioning hammocks for people to nap in or take a respite from the cruel sun and their explorations of the Playa.

We've also setup a mobile sno-cone crew to ride around the playa bringing sno-cones into people's camps.  We're outfitting them with an old timey "ice cream man" sound setup and we will be hunting for Burners in need of icy goodness.</p>

        <p class="description">Camp Red Sun is designed to be a place of fun and laughter.  We're an oasis away from the scorching sun and from any responsibilities of the outside world.

Joke telling is a huge part of our camp's experience and is integrated into our activities. With two large 30' tension tents, we have one that is high energy with music and a raging red sno-cone bar where people can laugh and play and another that is relaxing with furniture and cushions on the other side of camp where our guests can visit and get to know the people around them.

In addition we have a dodgeball court with multiple quirky themed games in a non-competitive friendly atmosphere.  Around camp there's a number of red self-tensioning hammocks for people to nap in or take a respite from the cruel sun and their explorations of the Playa.

We've also setup a mobile sno-cone crew to ride around the playa bringing sno-cones into people's camps.  We're outfitting them with an old timey "ice cream man" sound setup and we will be hunting for Burners in need of icy goodness.</p>

For many a maker the early formation of our creative drives were involved in one or more of the myraid forms of model building. "Guillow's Kit" is a hands on reconnection with this inception of manifesting the creative urge.
   The Playa art entitled 'Guillow's Kit' will spend the early part of the week completing the assembly and skinning of a 1:1 scale Mitsubishi Zero model that is patterened after the original Guillow's balsa model kits. The first stage will be assebling the wooden frame. The second stage will be covering the frame with reproductions of WWII era Japanese newspapers arranged to mimic the ensignia and detail of the original aircraft, with a little artistic liscence of course. You are invited to assist the artist at any point in the construction and completion of this 'Rite of Passage' themed artwork. 
As with many of the original kits, the artist's intention is to complete this artwork with fire after the man burns.</p>

        <p class="description">Have you ever dreamed of becoming an aerialist, but sweaty palms, a belief that you’re not strong enough, or a fear of heights has kept your feet on the ground? Get a taste of the circus heights with this intro to aerial lyra class, suitable for beginners. Sometimes called an aerial hoop or circeau, the lyra is a padded steel hoop that will be hung from a 20' tall fiberglass traveling rig at Camp Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves.  After a thorough warm-up and discussion of strengthening exercises with Christy Anandaconda, you’ll get to take your turn in the air! Exhilaration and laughter guaranteed. Pants or leggings recommended; sobriety required.  “Some kind of pants are an excellent idea; ten-yard skirts and inversion are a humorous but ineffectual combination.” ~Sadie</p>

We have regular and uv nail polish, manicure kits, lotions, oils, fake nails and jewels, spray bottles and uv airbrush paint. And don’t forgot, our bar is open for business 24 hours so bring your cups while you get those lovely hands softened up.</p>

        <p class="description">Kostume Kult has been "costuming the naked" since 2002 from our Esplanade Kostume Dome every day from Tuesday through Saturday Noon til 5pm-ish. Acquired over the past year from generous costume companies and burners around the world who recycle their past glory with love, we have over 1 ton of costumes to give away, all free (no barter or returns required) but note that you MUST wear what you take and walk the runway to be reborn onto the playa with a new look and attitude. It is important to note that, in line with BM's decommodification, gifting and immediacy principles, Kostume Kult's costume giveaway dome is not about giving products but empowering experiences. It is true that the sight of a dome full of free costumes makes eyes dilate, pulses quicken and drooling has been known to occur, but we request that you fight the consumerist urge to "acquire"-- to grab armfuls of stuff, to scurry away with thoughts of future times to wear or how there are others you want to supply. Instead we suggest that you stay in the moment, put something on that makes you feel special and that if you find something absolutely perfect and you see someone else admiring it, please consider taking it off and giving it to them. Playfulness, kindness and generosity are the coins of our realm and we hope you will share. Come by to participate and, if you have stuff to donate, please drop it off on-playa early in the week or, better yet, ship it to our Davis, CA logistics hub by contacting Jon at kkostumes@gmail.com to get the details.</p>

You will sit back in chair and place a pair of sun glasses that will have LEDs on the inside of the lens.  The LEDs are bright and are not meant to be stared into; you actually keep your eyes closed. Don’t worry; you control the light intensity so it’ll never be too bright or too dim.

Along with the light comes sound.  The lights will be pulsing at different brain frequencies.  The sound will be paired with the lights.  You basically sit back, relax and let yourself escape into a completely relaxed state.  The entire experience lasts 20 minutes, however you are free to stop at any time.  Look to the ski for the lights, follow them to Boo Boo City.</p>

        <p class="description">Dancing Freedom is a somatic, ecstatic and shamanic dance practice supporting the emergence of living oneness and what it truly means to be embodied. It is fun, and empowering. Any person of any age, size, color or creed can do it. We explore the ways in which the 5 elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Ether may assist us in creating a deeper relationship to our Selves, others, and our environment. By having an experiential understanding of how these elements work within us, we gain tools that help us to move through life and all of its lessons in a more centered and conscious manner. When we come together we come in peace to create a deep space of shared practice, transformation and community.
All one needs is the desire for health, vitality, happiness and a deeper connection to self and others. This is a free form movement practice that is safe for all abilities. It is a friendly entry point into movement as medicine and it’s a powerful addition to an existing yoga, meditation or healing practice.

Couples and groups are particularly encouraged. This year I will be shooting only between hours of 4 and 7PM.  Please be patient if I am already working with someone when you arrive.  I will give you my card and take your email and postal address information.  Your print will arrive in the mail within several weeks to two months of the event; hand-printed gelatin silver prints are a very laborious process! Please don't wear clothes with tight rubber bands to the shoot, as we'll have to wait for the lines to disappear.

Please note that the idea is not as much to document Burning Man as to take a portrait of you set in the gorgeous desert.  Therefore, I will probably ask you to remove such things as glitter, body paint and temp. tattoos.  BUT PLEASE BRING PROPS!  Dead animals, unusual (but not ravey) clothes, gas masks, medieval armor, etc.   

If you'd like to assist me on this project, please get in touch ahead of time.  I am looking for an assistant familiar with photographic process.  Your ticket is on me.</p>

It's apparent that we cannot rely on the hirearchical systems that created the mess we're in to solve the problem. How do we shift the seemingly unstoppable, markedly unconscious, and appallingly unsustainable direction of our human race - now?  Our only hope is the emergence of a well-functioning, self-organizing human system where the body, mind, heart, and spirit are awakened.  Join Raj Sundra (social entrepreneur), John Taylor (business and intellectual marvel), Allison Coleman (transformational educator), Michael Costurus (Lakota spiritualist and student of plant medicine in Peru), and Kim Iglinsky (one of the Bay Areas premier EFT trainers and formerly a prominent Israeli runway model) in a panel discussion on how to cause the rapid emergence of an integrated human system to source the creation of a sustainable, just and fulfilling world for all.</p>

It can also be the beginning of the exploration into control and surrender between you and your partner.  It can be a doorway into the psyche of both giver and receiver, showing them aspects of themselves that they have not thoroughly explored.

It can be a fun and pleasurable way of increasing intimacy with your partner.

Spanking can also be an amazing powerful channel for catharsis and release.

We will physically explore the concepts of community and  holding space for ourselves and others. Together, we will cultivate an inner and outer listening which will invite us into a place beyond words where instinct and intuition reign. 

The 5Rhythms “tribal work” is a practice where we cultivate the ability to be good leaders and a powerful part of a the collective.  In this 2 hour workshop we will artistically expand our capacity towards the kind of freedom that allows our own personal expressions to live and thrive in harmonious vibration with the whole.  We will dance, sweat and pray for the possibility to arrive into the breath-full, blissful meditative beat of the One.</p>

We don't accept any other recyclables, you must pack them out. And we definitely don't want your trash. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike that powers the can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV. Come join in the fun while doing a good thing for the planet and BRC..!</p>

If you do not have a Wonder Woman costume, togas or other "Goddess" atire is also appropriate. Dominatrix and BDSM gear also welcome! Bonus points for being able to spin in place without losing your balance to transform into your alter ego.

Women, do you need a little kinky revenge against men-kind? Learn about some safe and fun "painful practices" in a supportive, empowered environment.

Men, pay homage to the superior sex from Paradise Island and have an opportunity to atone for the sins of men-kind by receiving punishments and participating in Amazon bondage games (confess your sins while tied in her golden lasso).

Bring your favorite submissive of any gender but keep in mind this is a FEMDOM event, no male tops. Male switches must be in "sub mode."

Also, enjoy our Erotic Superhero Bar, including some very special explicit "shots." Get certified as a cocksucker, or force some straight boys to suck strap-on!</p>

Spencer will choose men, women and any gender identity to be part of this unique installation.

In order to be chosen we ask that you please send in a low resolution photograph of yourself.
Participants will be selected based on photographs submitted to the email: 
projects@spencertunick.com
Please send the image sooner rather than later.

Most installations by Spencer do not have limits to the number of people participating, nor do they require the submission of a photograph. However, for this art work for Burning Man, there is a cap on the number of people participating due to the specific concept of the work.
We are asking for a photograph because we want to have a wide range of body types and skin tonalities represented in the final work. Although everyone is unique, If you are not chosen, it is simply because we may have reached the amount of people with similar specific characteristics. We apologize in advance if you are not chosen for this particular idea but please do not let it deter you from posing in future works by Spencer where there are no number limits.

Chosen participants will be contacted by email prior to August 24th with: location and further instructions. Please only sign up if you are committed to participating and able to wake up before sunrise (or stay up all night). The work will take place before sunrise in order to utilize the pre-dawn light. You will be in position when the sun rises.

You only will be nude for a short period of time. 
...we know it's chilly...so you will not be nude until right before the sun rises over the horizon and as the sun hits your body. 5am is just the call time to get you registered.  We need everyone to be on time.  In exchange for taking part, you will receive by mail, a limited edition print of the art work. PARTICIPANTS ONLY. 
Thank-you!</p>

In 2005, filmmaker Keith Busha found himself drawn to Italy to view and film the art of a unique, largely unknown community. He found their extensive and extraordinary art to be only a very small piece of a story that consumed him for years. After many trips and much research, this self-proclaimed, road weary skeptic opened his eyes and mind to the wonders of this enlightened and innovative community.</p>

        <p class="description">Virgin Hooper Camp provides hoops of all sizes to make sure you learn the basics of body hooping. Did you hoop as a kid? You'll be hooping in no time, once you find the size that works for you. Never hooped before? We can teach you in 5 minutes and you'll be on your way to learning all the moves and tricks you see on the Playa. 

We'll be at 4:45 and G every morning from 10 a.m. to noon. But if we're home - it doesn't matter what time of day it is... We'll hoop with you!</p>

    You may write any length, style, form, content, voice, rhythm, etc.
    DO NOT EDIT your work. This is raw stuff, baby. That's part of the experiment. You are welcome to edit, collage, break apart the poems later for whatever purpose you choose, but please SHARE THE RAW STUFF with the rest of the group here or on the website once the experiment is over.
    (Optional) Do not read what you have written until the month is over, except to skim the work to make sure everything is legible.

HOWEVER: if you'd like to come by Art Predator's camp to share, please do! 

September 1: Transcribe your scribbles. (Don't edit!!)

Submit raw work to the 3:15 website on your own page. See what others have written in 2013 or previous years.</p>

Her son, John Froma (some say “frum Amerika”), unwittingly brought technological cargo to a relatively unspoiled culture. His gift (and her namesake) changed over time as the native population developed an appetite for and ultimately a reliance on all things technological. Those—YOU—who are participant in a culture promoting such cargo may query Johnna regarding its worth.

        <p class="description">Yogic tradition discusses seven chakras or subtle energy centers that regulate physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well being. When the chakras are open and balanced, so are we.  As doorways to higher consciousness, the chakras bridge the Human Energy Field and the Universal Energy Field.  Expand your experience of yoga beyond the physical dimension.  Discover, open, balance, and charge your subtle energy centers to allow more of the cosmic stream of life force to flow through you.  All levels welcome.</p>

        <p class="description">In Search of the Truth (The Truth Booth)
is an installation comprised of a touring, portable, inflatable ‘Truth Booth’ that embarked on a world tour at the Galway Arts Festival, Ireland in 2011 . The exterior is iconically shaped like a giant cartoon speech bubble with the word ‘TRUTH’ printed on the side. The interior acts much like a photo booth, but serves to compile 2 minute long video responses from the public. Once seated inside people are invited to record their opinions and thoughts as they finish the statement: “The truth is...”. 

Throughout this long-term project the video footage will be compiled and edited into a video installation. To expand and engage with audiences, the movements of The Truth Booth and sample responses will also be tracked, edited, and categorised on a dedicated website. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to try to capture as many definitions, confessions and thoughts on The Truth as possible, creating a diverse ‘portrait’ of people across the globe. 

The Cause Collective is a team of artists, designers and ethnographers creating innovative art in the public realm. Their projects explore and enliven public spaces by creating a dynamic conversation between issues, sites and the public audience. By exploring ideas that affect and shape society, they seek to add the ‘public’ back into public space and art.</p>

        <p class="description">The YEEEEE-SAWWWW! (screamed loudly with a typical Texas drawl to express joy or exuberance) promises to be the most interactive and entertaining see-saw you've ever experienced.

At 33' long x 28' tall, this perfectly balanced see-saw includes an adult playground comprised of a dance platform, pole and jungle gym. A center pole rises through the dance platform and moves with the Yee-Saw. Dancers can use this to radically express themselves while also controlling the riders' experience. Scale the triangular truss to operate from the top of the pole and for a great view of the playa.

This year, the machine has successfully entertained the nearly 3,000 member strong Burning Flipside community. It’s now eagerly waiting to play with all of you beautiful people.

Seatbelts ON!
It’s Yee-Saw Time!</p>

    Begin at 3:15 AM on August 1 (or whenever you can join!). Continue each day until August 31.
    You may write any length, style, form, content, voice, rhythm, etc.
    DO NOT EDIT your work. This is raw stuff, baby. That’s part of the experiment. You are welcome to edit, collage, break apart the poems later for whatever purpose you choose, but please SHARE THE RAW STUFF with us on the website after the experiment.
    (Optional) Do not read what you have written until the month is over, except to skim the work to make sure everything is legible.
    TIP: do not use a felt tip pen unless you don’t care about ink stains on your bed. Many a poet has fallen asleep in the middle of writing.
    If you can help it, don’t even get out of bed! The point is to ride that dream state, that precarious point between sleeping and waking and sleeping.

Then come by our camp to share your writing! Read on the Big TV Set or in the Dome of the Space Wanderer. 

If you're up at 3:15am, stop by our camp, be inspired by the otherworldly artwork, and write!</p>

        <p class="description">Here at Camp Make Good Choices we like to be inclusive. This year we will be doing a science fair for KIDS! We'll have snacks, drinks, and hands on science education. We'll cover several different topics and have interactive stations staffed with CMGC engineers and mentors! Given the breadth of ages, we'll do our best to cover as many age groups as we can with our science stations.
We'll also be screen printing a custom Science+Kids+CMGC graphic! Bring over a shirt or other material to receive the print! (cotton/poly blend is good and it needs to be fairly clean)

Parents, come over and take a seat. We'll chat with the kiddos for a while so have a refreshing adult beverage, relax for a bit, and get to know your friendly CMGC crew. (psss... we have a lot of adult oriented events as well, come back at 4 pm!)
We're commonly found in the 7:45ish area between B-D, but be sure to check the camp placement roster before heading over.</p>

        <p class="description">Party Naked Tiki Bar is a clothing optional bar returning to the Playa for our seventh year to provide “Tiki Punch” libations to thirsty Black Rock City citizens 21 and over. You must be 21 or over to Party here and we do ask for and check ID's (it's always good to carry your ID while at Burning Man). We start the mornings with Bloody Mary's at 9:00am until we run out. We then dispense our "Tiki Punch" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Nudity is never required but at Party Naked Tiki Bar it is rewarded. This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that "do it" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.</p>

        <p class="description">In the story of Hanuman (the mighty monkey deity of Hinduism) is a being with numerous gifts, and a faulty memory. On his path, he connects with others who remind him of his magical abilities. We are indeed mirrors for each other, with opportunity to reflect as the embodied unique contribution and how to bring more love and gratitude in the world. The Monkey Tantra is an experimental application of this idea, connecting together via loving human contact, vocalizing, visualizing, and inhabiting fearless graces through movement play and voice. Elements of dance, yoga, breath, chanting, and more combing to engage the body as a complete sensory organism. A sensory body is alert, animated, and alive. It resonated safety, security, and competence. It is ready for anything! This is an investigation, an exploration, a collaboration, a seriously FUN limitation-busting experiential living as we are - as ONE.</p>

        <p class="description">Do you wish there were some middle-of-the-night place where you could grab a seat and let your mind be doubly warped? Liminal Labs has you covered! After dark, all night long starting at 9:15, Tuesday through Friday, we invite you to Mirror Movie Mashup, where daring cinephiles grab a seat and watch TWO movies at once on our luxurious 53 foot wide double screen / trailer! Think of it, BARBARELLA & LOGAN’S RUN! THE HUNGER & ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE! DUMBO & CAROUSEL! REPO MAN & PULP FICTION! ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK & THE WARRIORS! STAR WARS & STAR TREK! Or talk us into showing your own mirrored movie picks from our extensive roster of fine films, tv shows and ridiculous youtube videos. All this and free popcorn, too!  No playa cinephile will walk away unsatisfied.  A roster of movie pairings is available at: http://www.zorca.com/liminallabs/mirrormovies or goo.gl/pJy4Fh

Also, do mornings on the playa find you a little dazed and hazy? From 11AM-1PM on Tuesday - Saturday, we happily throw open the Liminal Pharmakon where you are invited to choose from an apothecary menu full of salubrious nostrums, elixirs and vitamin-rich restoratives.</p>

        <p class="description">There are many things you 'could' do, but there's nothing you 'should' do. I suspect there's no such thing as a 'should'. A should is a 'could' with shame smuggled on top of it. Come explore shame and its cousins: guilt, envy, anger and jealousy. All these emotions have one thing in common, they usually hide their tracks and are hard to admit. Learn to transcend your shame with cutting edge subjective tools. We'll investigate the nature of shame & shaming, look at the adaptive advantages of them and how they serve & do not serve our development.

Join love coach Annie Lalla for some powerful exercises that will help you move beyond past shames and show you how desist from laying down new ones. This is a forum to discuss how to experience our emotions, especially the difficult ones, so they stop haunting your psyche.  You will leave shameless or at least shamelessly.</p>

The huge attendance last year truly showed the diversity of our community on the Playa. This annual event features music, libations and snacks and is a great place to reconnect with friends and/or a hottie from the past---or even a new hottie for 2015---right at the beginning of the week. It's also a great place to post & promote your own LGBTQQ-themed events for the week on our events board, so bring flyers and info of your events.</p>

In Black Rock City there is much to see, always, in the way of art-- buildings and structures, Art Cars and installations... but there's another kind of art to see, as it strolls around the Playa...
It's the often unique way each of us dress (or undress) for the event!
And each year, there's one gathering place where Playa Fashions shine their brightest.
That's the Big Stage in Center Camp Café. The day is Saturday, and the time right before the Burn, starting around 5:30 PM.
The PEOPLE'S FASHION SHOW, a tradition since 1987, is the place to see and be seen, as the amazing creations worn on the Playa have their moment before our audience on our Runway.
Join your hosts, Dr. Howland Owll and DJ Justin Credible, as we present this year's highlights of YOUR Incendiary Couture!
Fantastic outfits, puppets, body decoration or just one's signature Playa clothing-- anything and anyone may appear. Models assemble backstage.
Come and watch... or even better, be a part of it!</p>

        <p class="description">Party Naked Tiki Bar is a clothing optional bar returning to the Playa for our seventh year to provide “Tiki Punch” libations to thirsty Black Rock City citizens 21 and over. You must be 21 or over to Party here and we do ask for and check ID's (it's always good to carry your ID while at Burning Man). We start to dispense our "Tiki Punch" (yes, it has a punch) at 11:00am daily. Nudity is never required but at Party Naked Tiki Bar it is rewarded. This year we have 800 commemorative leis to give to citizens that "do it" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited or inappropriate touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day. Be LNT friendly and bring your own cup please.</p>

Just as the ocean is never separate from it's waves, so essence is never separate from all that is arising, moment to moment.</p>

        <p class="description">Not the kind of fun freaky night you imagined? Things getting a little too weird ...even for Burning Man? The Zendo Project is a place where you can find support during particularly challenging or overwhelming experiences, substance related or otherwise. The Zendo is staffed 24/7 with trained volunteers who offer peer-to-peer counseling support. This is a safe space to land and reconnect with yourself before you head off to your next adventure! We have two locations on D at the 9:00 and 3:00 keyholes. We are open all week, from 8pm on Monday the 29th until 8am on Monday the 5th. If you or a friend are in need of support, come find the Zendo!

Mission
The mission of the Zendo Project is to provide a supportive environment and education to help transform difficult psychedelic and psychological experiences into opportunities for learning and growth.
 
Vision
We envision a world where communities are engaged in providing safety and support for people having psychedelic and psychological challenges; and harm reduction principles are used foremost to reduce the risks associated with substance use.</p>

Far from a simple guide to whips and chains, there is a love story woven into the fabric of the S&M adventure.   From the agony of junior high dances to the inner sanctum of a professional dungeon, enemas to ecstatic dance (including a cameo from Gabrielle Roth), GGG: D4D explores what it means to fall in lust with yourself!</p>

AND...while you are there and if you dare, Thomas delFuego will let you choose a Rune from his pile of hand painted Runes. These stones on 10,000 year old sand concretions and will speak to your heart and that very moment:):):) Come join Thomas and Darma delFuego and become our friends for life!</p>

        <p class="description">Jimmy Descant, head artist of the "Amalgamated Debris Assemblage Guild" of Salida, CO. will conduct a special event on Thursday night, 7-9pm, called "The Speed Build" of found object assemblage art. Jimmy and the Guild are masters of turning parts from the Golden Age of American manufacturing into beautiful assemblages.
Audience artist participants thru the week who experience the ADA's booth can put in their name for a lottery to be drawn at 6:30 on Thursdays evening, to be one on 10 chosen artists for this special event. The 10 artists will get a blank board to work on, will choose their own subject matter for the art, and show it to Jimmy at the start of the build. Imagine speed chess!!! where Jimmy will take their suggestion, lay out a few pieces to start and instruct the artist to apply what he did, and as Jimmy works around to the other artists, they add their own vision until Jimmy comes back around, to compound the vision! All other Guild members will help with instruction, tools, and raw materials in this frantic 2 hour filmed creation of 10 unique works of art, finishing with flair and fire into the darkness! As with all created art during the week, the artists rule what happens when done... keep, showcase, give away, burn, gift it...</p>
