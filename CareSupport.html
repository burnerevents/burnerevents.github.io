        <p class="description">Come to Great Balls of Fire to receive the best care available on the Playa for women with two feet (or even one!). The alkaline quality of the Playa surface can dehydrate and damage our skin, and our feet get a big dose of it if you’re wearing sandals, flip-flops, or *going barefoot*. Our feet are a part of our bodies that are often receive far less attention than they deserve given how vital good foot health is for our mobility and overall well-being. So reconnect with your feet and revitalize them by pampering them with a Barefoot Bliss treatment that includes a lemon juice bathing to neutralize alkalinity, followed by a luxuriant reflexology foot massage using rehydrating lotion. The treatment requires being barefoot, (of course!) and utter bliss is the guaranteed result, hence the name. Your feet will thank you!
 
The gift of Barefoot Bliss is available throughout each day beginning Tuesday morning. Look for the Barefoot Bliss signs at the Great Balls of Fire camp and ask for Pringles. It’s offered primarily for women of the Playa, but Pringles will have a female assistant who will be available at select times for interested boyfriends and overflow women.</p>

        <p class="description">Kostume Kult has been "costuming the naked" since 2002 from our Esplanade Kostume Dome every day from Tuesday through Saturday Noon til 5pm-ish.  Acquired over the past year from generous costume companies and burners around the world intent to recycle past glory, we have over 1 ton of costumes to give away, all free (no barter or returns required) but note that you MUST wear what you take and walk the runway to be reborn onto the playa with a new look and attitude.

It is important to note that, in line with BM's decommodification, gifting and immediacy principles, Kostume Kult's costume giveaway dome is not about giving products but empowering experiences.  It is true that the sight of a dome full of free costumes makes eyes dilate, pulses quicken and drooling has been known to occur, but we request that you fight the consumerist urge to "acquire"-- to grab armfuls of stuff, to scurry away with thoughts of future times to wear or how there are others you want to supply.  Instead we suggest that you stay in the moment, put something on that makes you feel special and that if you find something absolutely perfect and you see someone else admiring it, please consider taking it off and giving it to them. Playfulness, kindness and generosity are the coins of our realm and we hope you will share.

Come by to participate and, if you have stuff to donate, please drop it off on-playa early in the week or, better yet, ship it to our Davis, CA logistics hub by contacting Maria and David at squamazon@gmail.com to get the details.</p>

Will detail the schedule when we know it.Come experience the healing work of the Hardest working & possibly the most Hilarious healer on the playa.  More than healings, but activations, ALLNESS blessings, empowerments, attunements. A true Guru's Grace in his touch.
Don't take his word for it. Here are just two of many thousands of similar testimonials:

Megan Read June 6 at 12:47am 
..My friend is in a coma she had a major heart attack and major stroke she has no brain function and her kidneys have failed and her body slowly shutting down and she has a 5 year old son no one knows what has caused this she has been in a coma 2 weeks now 

Megan Read June 13 at 2:58am 
Hey thanks for ur healing prayers for my friend.  A miracle happened this week. She woke up from her coma. The doctors said her organs had all shut down. She was brain dead and there was no hope of her waking up. But she woke up with no memory loss and the doctors can’t find much wrong with her.  She is up eating, talking, walking, doing everything natural. It’s a miracle! Doctors are amazed & so are every one of her friends and family 

Hi Whimsical,
... I'm the psychiatrist who treats actresses and writers (ha). I saw you two times .....You left an indelible impression on me. I can recall the state I found myself in while you were working on me. It allows me to return to that
place of consciousness where everything is allowed, nothing is resisted and the
deep longing I feel meets desire in every other molecule around me. Under your
touch there was hardly a you and a me.
There was just an experience of the fundamental vibration of love.</p>

        <p class="description">This Deeksha is dispensed the qintessential UNGURU, a healer who has gifted over 100,000 healings in his lifetime. 

One can not BUY the Grace of Shakti-Pat, DEEKSHA or ONENESS. The Sacred is not for Sale. That which is the highest costs you everything or it cost you Nothing. 

Nor can such Grace be attained to be dispensed upon others in a meaningful way by spending thousands of dollars and spending less than 2 weeks to learn. 

Come receive a simple TOUCH of MERCY & REDEMPTION. The Allness Blessing will open your crown, third eye, heart, activate and balance your endocrine system including your Pineal gland. 

Come release your pain at the Altar of Mercy and be reborn into your innate grace of being.  Feel your Heart Sing, your Spirit Soar and your pains begin to vanish. Come for a Blessing/Blissing. The only Price you pay is the loss of your Pain.
This service is most likely to be found at the Healing Dome at Entheon Village or the Heart Chakra healing space at Sacred Spaces but we will post the schedule or last minute changes here.</p>

        <p class="description">Belfast Flags in memory of Thomas Devlin:

Thomas Devlin was young man who was killed in 2005.  His family requested the creation of an arts event to give his death a positive legacy for the future.  In 2009 The "Belfast Flags of Hope" project was conceived and implemented as one way of helping to dismantle sectarian attitudes; and of trying to create a cultural atmosphere that will help to facilitate a brighter future.  There is a tradition of partisan flag flying in Northern Ireland that has always been highly contentious and divisive.  The Belfast Flags project seeks to use this divisive format in a new inclusive and positive way. 

Please join me (Bebop) on the Playa to take a picture with the Belfast Flags. It is an international project and people are encouraged to take pictures with the Belfast Flags EVERYWHERE in the world...clearly the Playa is a place Belfast Flag Flying needs to happen! Wear your Burner Best and join us for a unifying photo!

The self-referential hype, the notion that there is always someone else having more fun, and that you are always missing the good stuff can create an insurmountable right-of-passage. _____ The SpaMarine mutant vehicle will wander the playa, seek out those individuals who are having a rotten time, those who need a break from the fuzzy neon stimuli and missed connections. The SpaMarine will take in one person at a time and offer them a customized spa experience within a private, soothing, calm, and quiet environment. _____ No booze-laden party car, taxi-service, or overly cushioned snuggle-nest, the SpaMarine is instead a safe womb that comforts, recharges, and reassures those who are feeling lonely, sad, or out-of-place. _____ 
OUTSIDE:
The SpaMarine will entice a few participants to see past its cold exterior and dare to enter its comforting interior. The carefully fabricated exterior will impress with its faithful impression of a submarine and delight with its incongruity amongst the typical fantastical creations roaming the playa. While waiting for your personalized treatment, get a different perspective on the playa and calm yourself on our intimate outdoor second level. _____      
INSIDE:
Once inside the isolated and dust-free environment, a staff member may offer the single participant massage, aroma therapy, hard to glean insider information, comforting discussion, and interaction with a few familiar objects from the "normal" world. In conjunction with Playa Name Help, at the conclusion of your visit we will provide you with meaningful and respectful playa names to help you continue your own personal right-of-passage.</p>

        <p class="description">Why should we appreciate menstruation? Every woman should ask herself this. Sure, it may be no big deal, however it might be a big deal if you are consistently suffering or cursing your body for this cyclical occurrence. 

Menstruation can be seen as purely functional biologically, however, many cultures and traditions say otherwise. They viewed a woman's cycle as sacred and holy, sometimes, even cursed by the greatness of a woman's power during her bleeding time. 

Woman are often revered for their intuition and ability to create life through her womb. In honoring our mooncycle, we honor the gift we have to bring new life into this world, when we curse our blood, we're cursing our bodies, our children, the earth, and the gift of life itself. 

Now is the time to own the fullness of who you are as a woman; strong, beautiful, and full of love. Appreciate your body and all it does for you today and always! 

For more info and to participate in a menstruation rite of passage, come to my other workshops on the playa listed as: Menstruation, A Rite of Passage for Every Woman!</p>

The goal of Eyeland Oasis is to provide a tranquil oasis for fellow Burners to receive soothing care for their red, dusty eyes (organic chilled cucumber slices on the eyelids, chilled gel eye masks, herbal/saline eyedrops for self-application) and for their weary, under-appreciated feet (foot bath with a vinegar formula, massage and moisturizer application), while relaxing in reclining chairs or futons, listening to soft ambient music and wind chimes, and drinking lemon-slice-infused chilled water.  We will have an aesthetic and luxurious "spa" inside a 30' diameter shade tent with attractive/flowing fabrics and carpets and creative, entertaining graphics designed by several of our professional artist campmates.  We will be able to accommodate up to 6 "patients" at a time and will have 4 attendants on site during the afternoon hours. We will also gift eye cups decorated with an Eyeland Oasis/BMan logo.  We plan to bring 2, 55-gallon water containers, and will build an appro!
priate gray water/evap area.
To soften borders, open hearts, open arms and open eyes.
Enjoy the creativity of others' minds.
As adults, to remind people how to be playful.
To see and appreciate imagination become reality.
To continue to influence the macrocosm and microcosm of our worlds thru the BMan experience with our creativity and life choices throughout the year.</p>

We're here to support you. We also want to offer a place for people to talk about their coping strategies and serve as a resource to those in need. Discuss how to avoid or at least mitigate triggers. Offer stories of what has been successful and what hasn't worked as well for you. Or just come to listen and know you are not alone. 

For those in need of more acute counseling and treatment, we encourage you to seek out the mental health services offered on the playa, and assist you to take advantage of them if needed.</p>

        <p class="description">The Sapphire Portal was inspired by concepts in The Emerald Modem: A Users Guide to the Earth’s Interactive Energy Body (2004). Author Richard Leviton describes etheric “blue dishes” under all sacred sites that collect subtle cosmic energies and distribute them into the earth and atmosphere. For Burning Man 2007 I designed a sky blue dish 61 feet in diameter and 9 1/2 feet high with sky blue carpet to physically manifest this idea while providing an environment of floating in the sky. In the center are three geometric forms that embody Leviton’s concept of an aspect of the Earth’s energy body evolving from its current geometric form to an icosidodecahedron. I built a half dodecahedron that houses the Quasar Wave Transducer sound sculpture that produces low frequency vibrations in the range of brain waves and earth resonance, and a half icosidodecahedron steel frame covered in stainless steel mirror triangles. These two shapes are shaded by a half icosahedron steel frame covered in aluminet shade cloth so that one may experience these shapes both day and night. A 30 foot section facing east was opened during sunrise. The Sapphire Portal acted as a personal, planetary and galactic vibrational alignemnent environment, providing profound experiences for many participants.</p>

In the tradition of Terrence McKenna, we will get together and share our past voyages and impressions of the psychedelic experience. In the psychedelic state, to quote McKenna, "One hears and beholds a language of alien meaning that is conveying alien information that cannot be Englished. Being monkeys, when we encounter a translinguistic object, a kind of cognitive dissonance is set up in our hindbrain. We try to pour language over it and it sheds it like water off a duck's back." We will push the envelope of language to see if we can go ahead and English some of that alien information after all. Perhaps art, music or dance will play a part in expressing these otherwise inexpressible concepts. All are welcome, whether experienced with the psychedelic state or not. Please note: this is a discussion group only; illegal substances and activities are not welcome in our camp. Please respect our need to keep our camp safe and 100% legal. Thank you so much.</p>

Find love?
Fix a relationship?
Tell the truth?
Lose weight?
Create a new career?
Dismantle your excuses?
Be happy?
Take down your dark side?
Start dreaming again?
Stop limiting what's possible for yourself?
And LOVE your whole LIFE?

Guess what is standing in your way? YOU! 
And we're here to fix that. Like a chiropractor who adjusts your body, we adjust your life emotionally, mentally and spiritually, helping you see what's holding you back and giving you the tools to create the life you want.

Camp IMAGINEnation is a life coaching camp dedicated to the power of dreaming and radical honesty. Our Life Coaches are trained in The Handel Method and go through an extensive 2-year or more training process on life issues and human behavior. 

Camp IMAGINEnation was founded by The Handel Group and born of an authentic and ambitious desire to change the world in a very positive way. It is a spiritual endeavor for us. We think that those who are willing to dig deep and look at themselves honestly are the most courageous people in the world, not to mention, people we’d want to hang with. In a word, we are looking to make personal development cool. We think it is. 

The Handel Method was developed over the last 15 years by HG Co-founder and Chairman, Lauren Zander. The method is the foundation for not only our life coaching work, but also for the courses we teach at MIT, NYU, Rutgers and Stanford Business Schools, and for the work we do within large companies in the Executive Coaching Division. The method is revolutionary yet easy to understand, methodical yet infinitely customizable. Most importantly of all, it has proven to be highly effective.

Together we dig deep, play big and don’t stop until goals are fulfilled and lessons learned. We care, we love what we do and we walk our talk.</p>

We are bringing the best of british mums to the playa. With 1950's cockney british mums handing out tea and sympathy and firm but fair advice for the burner that feels a little burnt out, or perhaps just needs a cuddle. Taken a bit too much? feel like you need the guidance of a mum in your life? We all love a mum but sometimes you just cant tell her everything you've been up to, well now you can."</p>

We are the Emotional Cargo Holding Office and we're here to help relieve you of your burdens. We'll let you talk through it, write it down, or both - and then you can just put it on file with us (by last name).  If you want us to mail it to you, of course we can (since we are part and partner of the PO9).  If you want us to have it burned with the Temple, we'll take it out there to the Temple Guardians (another of our strategic partners).  We will do our best to do whatever our customer desires - the important thing is that we send you back out on the playa with far less emotional cargo. We plan to be open from 12-5 each day with possible additional hours in the evenings.</p>

Located in an open-air yurt-like structure, the Zendo will have trained volunteers available to offer peer-to-peer counseling 24/7 from Wednesday 8/27 afternoon through Monday 9/1. 

The basic principles of our approach include: 
1. Create a safe space 
2. Sitting, not guiding 
3. Talk through, not down 
4. Difficult is not the same as bad. 

A challenging psychological experience is not necessarily a bad one. With proper preparation and understanding, it is possible to help someone having a difficult experience so they can receive the most benefit from it.</p>

Did that furry guy ride by and you suddenly felt compelled to violence?

Accidentally hook up with a stage 5 clinger, and they're just not getting the hint? 

Perhaps you're mildly disappointed that every single event participant is not driven to spontaneous orgasm & backflips upon learning of your niche politic / lifestyle choices?

Are you too repressed and insecure to directly confront all the trifling mothafuckas driving you insane with rage? 

Well don't let all that pent up aggression drive you to stab everyone, come get it out so you (and everyone around you) can enjoy the rest of the Burn!

Technique will be introduced in camp, but actual practice will occur on the playa, at whichever big piece of art is closest.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p class="description">The Zendo is a community outreach project at Burning Man that offers education and psychological support, with the goal to help reduce the potential harms involved in drug use. Volunteers provide peer-to-peer harm reduction support for individuals having a difficult drug-related experience and who don't require medical care. Guests are sometimes actively on substance, and other times are seeking integration support, or education about the risks involved in drug use. We staff the space 24/7 with trained mental health and medical professionals who provide oversight, as well as individuals experienced in crisis response.

If you'd like to come to the training to learn more about volunteering, it will take place at Something Freaky This Way Foams, near 2:00&G, on Tuesday September 1 at 11AM. 

The four principles of psychedelic harm reduction include: 

1. Create a safe space - If someone is having a challenging experience try to move them into a comfortable, warm, and calm environment. If possible, try to avoid noisy or crowded spaces. Ask what would make them most comfortable. Offer blankets and water. 

2. Sitting, not guiding - Be a calm presence of acceptance, compassion, and caring. Promote feelings of trust and security. Let the person's unfolding experience be the guide. Don't try to get ahead of their process. Explore distressing issues if they want, but know that simply being with the person is supportive and talking may not be helpful.

3. Talk through, not down - Invite the person to explore what's happening and encourage them to try not to resist it. Remind them that they are safe. 

4. Difficult is not the same as bad - challenging experiences can wind up being our most valuable and lead to learning and growth. Help the person integrate the experience, and remind them the experience will continue to unfold.</p>

        <p class="description">Many of us come from cultures where physical touch and speaking openly is discouraged. Even in the swirling world of self-expression that is Burning Man, people can easily miss simple human contact. Our camp wants to see each individual spirit, to hear each story and to offer moments of real connection. We plan to offer: 
●	60 seconds or more of Intentional Gazing. 
●	Five Minutes or more of Focused Listening. 
●	Generous Hugs - just as long as each visitor wants. 
from 1 to 5 PM, Mon through Fri. (or pretty much any time we’re in our big round public living room). We want to empower and encourage our campers and visitors to continually offer these same three tokens of human contact through out BlackRock City and on our travels all over the world. 
We will have paints and card stock so anyone who wants one has a chance to paint their own sign to offer hugs, gazing and listening. 
We'll have other spontaneous events so check our sign! Relax with us! Have some Water!</p>

You will first participate in helping other Burning Man friends get washed by spraying them with Water, Dr. Bonners Peppermint Soap, washed with plenty of hands by your Playa neighbors, then sprayed again with water and squeeged off before you depart for more Playa fun. Bring a water donation to help the process along.</p>

For the fourth year in a row Healing Foot Wash is coming again to Burning Man!  Find us on Rod's Road and take a load off your feet for a few minutes.  We follow a simple 4 step process:
1) Diluted vinegar to neutralize the alkaline dusty pH
2) Diluted Dr. Bronner's soap to release the dust
3) Pure water rinse
4) Dry feet and apply foot lotion

Sit and enjoy the attention in our open shade structure and chat for a while.  We're totally family friendly and welcome participation in foot washing.

Our 1 rule:
You can only wash feet after you've had your feet washed.

Come by and say hi! :)</p>

A securely fitting hat helps to prevent losing your head protection in the wind or on a bike and to prevent MOOP.  If you already have a hat, then gift one to someone in need of head protection.  Located in the Village behind Barbie Death Camp.  After viewing the Barbie Art, look for maps, street signs or ask & some people will point toward my direction.  i'm usually not far from camp, but occasionally my view is obstructed by parked vehicles.

Often called the windows to your soul, we believe your eyes hold special meaning and represent so much of your inner beauty. We hope to enhance your unique eyes, and allow your inner beauty to shine through!
While Julie works on your eyes, we will complete an Astrology reading based on both your main Astrological sign and your Rising sign. We hope this will help you reflect a little more on who you are, and open yourself up to everything the universe has in store for you at Burning Man.
In addition to the make-up and Astrology readings, we will immerse you with a calming and reflective environment using natural wind chimes and aroma therapy. Based on some simple questions, we will try to assess your personal mood, tastes and physical needs. We will suggest some remedies using over (30) of the finest grade natural oils. We will suggest a combination of remedies that may include taste, touch and smell to help you rejuvenate.

You will also be served a relaxing organic herbal tea.

Eyes of the Soul wants you to feel even better than felt when you arrived. We are happy to send you out to the playa refreshed, rejuvenated, and better equipped to deal with the elements</p>

We are all dreamers, there is no other
We share a dream that spans space and time.
We ignite the dreamer within us, lighting up new ideas. 
We connect hearts, bodies, minds with our passionate pursuits, mobilizing movements with our community.

Dreamers do because we love.
The Dream Society creates the experience of the shared dream, seeding inspirations for each other. We share joyfully.
We care for ourselves and reach out to each other in this ongoing process of self-tuning and collaborative alignment. We hone each other by being honest with each other, seeking to be our best by reflecting the best in each other.
Our space is dedicated to collaborative dreaming. In this society, our shared dreams create reality.

We begin by transmitting open space for exploration.
Through play, song, poetry, light, art, science and discovery we explore timeless wisdom, rhythm and the beat of a shared signal.
We create nourishment for each other and experiment with tools for wellbeing to enhance our abilities together.
Dreamspace happens when we come together and share passions. The society we share is decentralized, open and available to participation. Our place is open as sanctuary to lucid dreamers and explorers from all walks.
The dream becomes more intricate and real as we weave ourselves together in vast experiences, a dreamcatcher mandala of jeweled moments tied together through our people.
Our shared dream becomes a sparkling dance of culture creation, improvising to flow with the surreal systems around us to create the world we want to live in.

Our dreamspace is open to share.
We invite you to relax and dive deep within the Dream Society to amplify and transmit your vision with others.
Dance, create, flow, love and be yourself in the shared dance of culture creation. In this play we become both the dreamers and the dream of who we want to be, in this world, together.</p>
